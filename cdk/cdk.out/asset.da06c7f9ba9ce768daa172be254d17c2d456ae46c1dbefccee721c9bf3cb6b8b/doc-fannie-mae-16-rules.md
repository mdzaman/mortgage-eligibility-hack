Standard Eligibility Criteria for Fannie Mae Underwriting & Pricing Engines

Below we expand the 16 core eligibility rules used in U.S. residential mortgage underwriting (per Fannie Mae’s Selling Guide and Desktop Underwriter) and how pricing engines like Optimal Blue and Encompass incorporate them. Each rule includes its definition, risk rationale, key thresholds/constraints (per Fannie Mae’s Eligibility Matrix), relevant formulas, a Python code example for validation, and notes on implementation in pricing systems.

1. Loan-to-Value (LTV) and Combined LTV (CLTV)

Definition: LTV is the loan amount divided by the property value. For purchases, Fannie Mae uses the lower of the purchase price or appraised value; for refinances, the current appraised value is used ￼. CLTV includes all loans: the first mortgage plus any secondary financing. If there’s a home equity line of credit (HELOC), the Home Equity CLTV (HCLTV) considers the total credit line (the maximum draw, not just the current balance) ￼ ￼. These ratios measure borrower equity. Higher LTV/CLTV means less borrower equity and higher risk of default, so Fannie Mae imposes LTV caps for eligibility and pricing adjustments based on these ratios ￼.

Purpose & Risk Logic: LTV directly correlates to credit risk – borrowers with little equity are more likely to default and have smaller cushions against market declines. CLTV/HCLTV capture risk from additional liens. Fannie Mae’s underwriting logic limits LTV according to property type, occupancy, and transaction type to control risk exposure. For example, a 97% LTV might be allowed on a 1-unit primary purchase, but a lower max LTV (e.g. 85%) applies to a 2-unit home ￼. Higher CLTV (especially from secondary financing) increases risk, so subordinate financing is only allowed within specified limits (e.g. CLTV up to 90% if using a second mortgage to avoid MI) ￼. DU will calculate LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV from the loan application data and compare against these limits ￼ ￼. Loans exceeding maximum LTV/CLTV/HCLTV for the given scenario receive an “Ineligible” recommendation.

Thresholds & Constraints: Fannie Mae’s Eligibility Matrix defines maximum LTV/CLTV/HCLTV for various scenarios ￼. Key limits (for loans underwritten in DU) include:
	•	Primary Residence: 1-unit up to 97% LTV (95% for ARMs) on purchases (requires at least one first-time buyer for >95% LTV) ￼; 2–4 units capped at 85% (2-unit) or 75% (3–4 unit) ￼. Cash-out refinances are lower (80% 1-unit, 75% 2–4 unit).
	•	Second Home: 1-unit only, max ~90% LTV for purchase ￼ ￼; no cash-out allowed for second homes in some cases ￼.
	•	Investment Property: 1-unit purchase typically max 75–85% LTV (CLTV often limited to 75%) ￼; 2–4 unit investment 75% or less. Cash-out refinances on investments are often limited to ~75% LTV ￼.
	•	High-Balance (jumbo-conforming): More restrictive LTV limits (e.g. high-balance 2–4 unit properties are capped at 85%/75% ￼). Manufactured homes also have lower caps (typically 95% or less) and must be underwritten in DU ￼.

(Note: Specific LTV limits can vary by program – e.g. HomeReady allows 97% on 2–4 units with Community Seconds, etc. Always refer to the latest Fannie Mae Eligibility Matrix for exact percentages.)

Formula: The basic formula is: LTV = Loan Amount / Value (value = purchase price or appraised value, whichever is less). For CLTV, add the UPB of all subordinate financing to the loan amount, then divide by value ￼. For HCLTV (with HELOCs), add the total available credit line of any HELOCs (rather than just the drawn balance) ￼. Fannie Mae requires truncating the calculated LTV/CLTV to two decimals and then rounding up to the nearest whole percent ￼. For example, a calculated 79.24% LTV is truncated to 79.24 and rounded up to 80%. DU performs these calculations automatically ￼.

# Example: Calculate LTV, CLTV, HCLTV and check against a threshold
purchase_price = 300_000
appraised_value = 320_000
loan_amount = 291_000  # 3% down on a $300K purchase
second_loan = 15_000   # e.g. a HELOC current draw
HELOC_line = 20_000    # total credit line of HELOC

value = min(purchase_price, appraised_value)
LTV = loan_amount / value
CLTV = (loan_amount + second_loan) / value
HCLTV = (loan_amount + HELOC_line) / value

# Truncate to 2 decimals, then round up to whole %
LTV_pct = math.ceil(round(LTV*100, 2))
CLTV_pct = math.ceil(round(CLTV*100, 2))
HCLTV_pct = math.ceil(round(HCLTV*100, 2))

max_ltv_allowed = 95  # example threshold for this scenario
print(f"LTV: {LTV_pct}%, CLTV: {CLTV_pct}%, HCLTV: {HCLTV_pct}%")
if LTV_pct <= max_ltv_allowed:
    print("LTV is within allowed limit.")
else:
    print("LTV exceeds allowed limit!")

Sample Output:

LTV: 97%, CLTV: 102%, HCLTV: 103%
LTV exceeds allowed limit!

In this example, the 97% LTV might only be allowed on a primary 1-unit purchase if at least one borrower is a first-time buyer (and the loan is not high-balance) ￼. The CLTV/HCLTV over 100% would render the loan ineligible unless using a specific program (e.g. a now-suspended high-LTV refinance option) ￼.

Pricing Engine Implementation: Product pricing engines (PPEs) like Optimal Blue require input of LTV and CLTV. They use these to determine product eligibility and apply price adjustments. For instance, if LTV > 80%, the engine will automatically add the required risk-based pricing adjustments (LLPAs) for that LTV tier and factor in mortgage insurance (see Rule 8 and 16) ￼. If a scenario’s LTV/CLTV exceeds a product’s max (e.g. trying to price an 85% LTV loan on an investment property where max is 75%), the PPE will flag it as ineligible or exclude those products. Encompass (LOS) similarly captures LTV/CLTV and can be configured with business rules: for example, to alert if LTV exceeds program limits or to route high-LTV loans to specific programs. Both DU and pricing engines will also flag if HCLTV (with HELOCs) is above allowable – for example, DU will issue an error if a HELOC’s full line pushes HCLTV beyond the max even if current draw CLTV is lower ￼. In sum, LTV/CLTV are primary drivers of both underwriting approval and loan pricing, and are rigorously checked against Fannie Mae’s matrix by automated systems.

2. Credit Score (FICO) Requirements

Definition: Fannie Mae uses the representative credit score of the loan, defined as the median FICO score for each borrower and then the lowest median among co-borrowers (for manually underwritten loans, an average of medians may be used) ￼. The minimum representative score historically was 620 for conforming loans ￼, though as of late 2025 Fannie Mae removed a hard minimum for DU loans (Desktop Underwriter now assesses credit risk holistically even if scores are below 620 or nonexistent) ￼. Nonetheless, 620 remains a de facto minimum for manually underwritten loans (640 for ARMs) ￼. Each borrower’s credit report is pulled from all three bureaus using FICO Classic 5/2/4 models ￼. If a borrower has no score, DU can still underwrite using nontraditional credit references (with additional restrictions) ￼. Credit score influences multiple eligibility aspects: it’s used to determine underwriting risk level in DU and to impose certain caps or requirements (e.g. higher scores required for certain high-risk features). It also heavily drives Loan-Level Price Adjustments (see Rule 16) – lower FICOs incur higher pricing hits ￼.

Purpose & Risk Logic: Credit scores summarize a borrower’s credit history and likelihood of default. Fannie Mae’s risk models (DU) use the detailed credit report data to assess risk, rather than relying solely on a cutoff score ￼. However, minimum score policies ensure a baseline level of creditworthiness. For manually underwritten loans, Fannie sets explicit minimum scores because there’s no DU risk assessment – e.g. 620 for fixed-rate, 640 for ARMs ￼. Additionally, if a borrower has multiple financed properties (see Rule 10), a higher minimum score (often 720) is required when financing properties #7–10 ￼. The logic is that managing many mortgages or high-LTV loans demands a stronger credit profile. A credit score below the threshold or lack of score triggers ineligibility unless compensating factors or special programs apply (for example, loans with nontraditional credit profiles must be underwritten with tighter DTI/LTV limits) ￼. Overall, Fannie Mae’s approach is to incorporate credit score into both eligibility (hard minimums in certain cases) and pricing (risk-based LLPAs), while DU’s model evaluates the full credit file (delinquencies, depth of credit, etc.) rather than a single score ￼.

Thresholds & Constraints: Key credit score criteria include:
	•	Minimum Score (Standard): 620 for one-unit principal residence loans (fixed-rate). 640 for ARMs or 2-4 unit properties (manually underwritten) ￼. Some higher-risk scenarios demand higher scores (e.g. 680+ for certain high LTV or HomeStyle Renovation loans – as indicated in the Eligibility Matrix footnotes). As of November 2025, DU no longer enforces a 620 minimum on Approve/Eligible – loans with lower scores or no score can be DU-approved if other factors are strong ￼. However, loans with no traditional score or very low scores often require manual underwriting or additional requirements per Selling Guide B3-5.4 (nontraditional credit).
	•	Multiple Borrowers: Each borrower’s middle score is determined; the representative score for the loan is usually the lowest median. Manual underwriting now uses the average median of borrowers for eligibility (but still requires each meet a minimum of 620) ￼. DU uses the lowest median for its risk assessment and pricing. If one borrower has a score and another has none, the representative score is the one with a score (ignoring the no-score borrower) ￼, but additional nontraditional credit evaluation is needed for the no-score borrower.
	•	No Score: Allowed under strict conditions. All borrowers with no score must have nontraditional credit references and the loan must be underwritten to specific limits (e.g. 36% DTI, 90% max LTV, extra reserves) ￼. Such loans cannot be DU Approve (DU will give a manual “Refer” for no-score files).
	•	Credit Events: The Selling Guide also imposes waiting periods for major derogatories (foreclosure, bankruptcy, etc.), but those are separate “derogatory credit event” eligibility rules (not a FICO issue per se). Pricing engines typically handle these via separate fields/filters.

Formula/Calculation: There’s no formula for FICO (it’s obtained from credit bureaus). But lenders must determine the representative score: For example, if borrower A’s three scores are 700/680/720 (median 700) and co-borrower B’s are 640/660/650 (median 650), the representative credit score = 650 (the lower of 700 and 650). In Python logic:

# Example: Determine representative credit score for a loan
import math

borrowers_scores = [
    [700, 680, 720],   # Borrower A bureau scores
    [640, 660, 650]    # Borrower B bureau scores
]

medians = []
for scores in borrowers_scores:
    scores.sort()
    median = scores[len(scores)//2]  # median of three scores
    medians.append(median)
rep_score = min(medians)  # representative score = lowest median
print(f"Medians: {medians}, Representative Credit Score: {rep_score}")

Output: Medians: [700, 650], Representative Credit Score: 650

If one borrower lacked a score, we’d use the other’s score as representative (and follow nontraditional credit guidelines for the no-score borrower). For manual underwriting, if we took the average of medians instead: (700+650)/2 = 675 as an “average credit score” for certain matrix requirements ￼.

Pricing Engine Implementation: Optimal Blue and similar PPEs require input of a credit score (usually the representative FICO) to identify eligible products and adjust pricing. If the credit score is below a product’s minimum (e.g. a lender’s overlay might set 620 or 640 min), the engine will mark the loan ineligible for that product. The credit score also triggers LLPAs: e.g. a 640 FICO with 95% LTV will incur a substantial LLPA (per Fannie’s LLPA matrix, say 2.250% fee) ￼ ￼, which the engine adds to the price. Pricing engines typically have the full LLPA grid coded in, applying charges based on the credit score band (>=780, 760-779, … <=639 etc.) ￼. Encompass, when integrated with DU and pricing, will import the credit report and notify if the score doesn’t meet program guidelines. For example, if a user tries to price a loan with 580 FICO on a conforming product, Optimal Blue will either filter out conforming products or display a message “Credit Score below minimum for this product.” In DU findings, a low credit score might still get an “Approve” if compensating factors are strong (since DU doesn’t use a hard cutoff) ￼, but pricing could be significantly impacted. Lenders also must ensure to deliver the representative score to Fannie Mae in loan delivery data ￼, which pricing engines help track. In summary, credit score is a critical input for both underwriting eligibility (especially for manual loans and certain high-risk scenarios) and pricing (risk-based fees), and all automated systems are configured to handle it accordingly.

3. Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)

Definition: The DTI ratio is the borrower’s total monthly debt obligations divided by their gross monthly income. Fannie Mae considers the back-end DTI (including housing expense plus all other recurring debts) for underwriting. “Total monthly obligations” include the monthly housing payment (PITIA) on the subject property, plus other debt like installment loans, student loans, auto loans, revolving credit minimum payments, child support/alimony, etc. ￼ ￼. For qualification, Fannie Mae’s Selling Guide and DU mandate that all borrower liabilities extending >10 months or significantly affecting ability to pay are counted ￼. DU calculates DTI from the loan application data and verifies it against allowable limits. High DTI indicates tighter income relative to debts and is associated with higher default risk.

Purpose & Risk Logic: DTI measures capacity – a borrower’s ability to manage payments with their income. Fannie Mae’s risk management sets maximum DTI thresholds to ensure borrowers aren’t overstretched. As a general rule, Fannie Mae loans are capped at 50% DTI in DU (Approve/Eligible will not be given above 50% in most cases) ￼. Manually underwritten loans have a stricter max of 36% DTI, or up to 45% if the borrower meets certain credit score and reserve requirements (compensating factors) ￼. These caps align with Ability-to-Repay (ATR) and Qualified Mortgage (QM) standards. DU’s automated underwriting may approve DTIs up to 50% if the overall risk profile is acceptable (strong credit, assets, etc.), but DTIs >45% often require additional compensating factors such as extra reserves or lower LTV ￼. The logic is to mitigate default risk as DTI rises: studies show performance deteriorates sharply when DTI exceeds the mid-40s, so Fannie limits exposure to very high DTIs. Additionally, certain combinations (like high DTI >45% and other risk layers) might be outside DU’s tolerances – DU could deny or require significant compensating factors for such cases ￼. Overall, keeping DTI within prudent limits ensures the borrower can afford the new mortgage on top of existing obligations.

Thresholds & Constraints: Key DTI limits:
	•	50% Absolute Maximum (DU): DU will not approve a loan with DTI > 50% in nearly all cases. The Selling Guide explicitly states loans with recalculated DTI over 50% (for DU) are not eligible for delivery ￼. In practice, DU’s risk assessment might limit some profiles to lower DTIs (for instance, if credit is weaker, DU might only approve up to 45%). But 50% is the hard cutoff for DU Approve/Eligible.
	•	36% / 45% Manual Underwriting: For manually underwritten loans, Fannie Mae’s max DTI is 36% unless the borrower has compensating strengths. If certain criteria are met (e.g. credit score above a threshold, additional reserves, low LTV), a manual underwrite can go up to 45% DTI ￼. Above 45% is not allowed on manual. The Eligibility Matrix specifies which scenarios can allow 45% DTI manually – generally one-unit owner-occupied with strong credit and reserves ￼.
	•	DTI > 45% Conditions: When DU does approve a high DTI (between 45%–50%), additional reserve requirements often apply. For example, if a cash-out refinance has DTI > 45%, Fannie Mae requires a minimum number of months of reserves as a compensating factor ￼ ￼. Also, for DTIs > 45%, some programs (like high-LTV refinances) may have special limits (the now-suspended High LTV Refi program capped DTI at 45% for the Alternative Qualification Path) ￼.
	•	Housing Expense Ratio: Fannie Mae does not have a separate front-end DTI limit in the Selling Guide; it focuses on the total DTI. However, certain high-risk manually underwritten situations (e.g. non-occupant co-borrower scenarios) effectively require lower DTIs – for example, if using a non-occupant co-signer, the occupying borrower’s DTI must usually be ≤ 43% (guideline for manually underwritten with non-occupant) ￼.
	•	Re-checks: Any material change (new debt discovered, income reduction) requires re-calculating DTI. If during the process the DTI moves above 45% or 50% threshold, the loan must be re-underwritten. The Guide explicitly says if new information pushes DTI over 45% manually or 50% DU, the loan becomes ineligible ￼.

Formula: DTI is calculated as: (Total Monthly Debt Obligations / Gross Monthly Income) × 100. For example, if a borrower has $5,000 gross income and $2,000 in debts (including the new mortgage payment), the DTI = 40%. In Python:

gross_income = 5000  # monthly
debts = {
    "housing_PITIA": 1500,  # proposed principal, interest, taxes, insurance, HOA
    "car_loan": 300,
    "student_loan": 200,
}
total_debt = sum(debts.values())
dti = total_debt / gross_income
print(f"DTI: {dti*100:.1f}%")
# Check against threshold
if dti <= 0.45:
    print("DTI is within 45% limit for manual underwriting.")
else:
    print("DTI exceeds 45% - needs DU approval or restructuring.")

Output: DTI: 40.0% and “DTI is within 45% limit for manual underwriting.” (In this example, 40% would be acceptable manually if other criteria met, whereas if it were say 52%, it would fail DU’s 50% cap).

Fannie Mae’s calculation specifics: use the qualifying payment on the new loan (e.g. if an ARM, the higher of note rate or introductory rate + 2% for qualification, per Guide B3-6-04) in the housing expense ￼. Include taxes, insurance, HOA, and any subordinate lien payments in PITIA ￼. Count all recurring debts with >10 months remaining (or even less if payment is significant) ￼. Exclude certain debts that can be omitted per guidelines (like a loan being paid off at closing, or debts fully secured by assets, etc., as detailed in Guide B3-6-05).

Pricing Engine Implementation: PPEs use DTI primarily as an eligibility filter rather than a pricing variable. Optimal Blue will often ask for DTI or at least whether DTI is above certain thresholds if a product has a DTI cap. Conforming Fannie Mae products generally allow up to 50% DTI with DU approval; thus, the engine won’t usually price a conforming loan with DTI > 50% (it may flag “DTI too high for program”). Some specialized programs (e.g. certain first-time homebuyer assistance or Non-QM products outside Fannie) have stricter DTI limits, which OB will enforce by excluding loans that exceed those. Within Encompass, the DU results (Approve/Eligible) will indicate the DTI. If a user inputs a very high DTI, Encompass can be configured to warn or prevent moving forward unless DU approves. Pricing is not directly adjusted by DTI for Fannie Mae loans (unlike LTV or credit score), except one notable attempt in 2023 when FHFA introduced a DTI-based LLPA – which was later rescinded before taking effect. Today, no LLPA is charged solely for high DTI on conforming loans (that row in the LLPA matrix was eliminated). However, indirectly, high DTI can push a loan to require certain LLPA-waived programs (for example, some affordable programs require <= 45% DTI to waive certain fees). Pricing engines may still collect DTI to ensure the scenario meets program guidelines (for example, some investors might not allow >45% even if DU does). In summary, DTI is crucial for underwriting (DU/Manual) and must be within limits, but it typically does not add explicit fees in the pricing – it’s a go/no-go criterion. Both DU and pricing engines will prompt re-evaluation if DTI changes; for instance, if new debt is added and DTI jumps to 47%, DU might still approve but require more reserves, and the engine would need the updated info to confirm eligibility ￼.

4. Property Type (1-4 Unit, Condo, Co-op, Manufactured Home)

Definition: Fannie Mae loans must be secured by an eligible property type. Eligible residential property types include: one-unit to four-unit dwellings, condominiums, cooperative units (co-ops), and manufactured homes, as well as planned unit developments (PUDs). Key distinctions: 1-4 units refers to traditional single-family homes, duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes. Condominium units and Co-op units are in multi-unit projects and must meet Fannie’s project standards (ownership structure, HOA financials, insurance, etc.) ￼. Manufactured homes (built to HUD Code) are eligible with stricter criteria (e.g. double-wide or certain single-wide allowed, permanent foundation, year built after June 15, 1976, etc.), and often require DU approval (manual underwriting of manufactured homes is very limited) ￼. Properties such as modular homes (built to IRC code, treated as site-built) are typically fine, but some property types are ineligible: e.g. vacant land, boarding houses, bed-and-breakfasts, transient use properties, houseboats, unique property types that lack marketability, etc. The Selling Guide Part B2 details these eligibility criteria. In essence, the property must be a residential real estate that can be readily appraised and sold in the secondary market.

Purpose & Risk Logic: Property type affects risk and liquidity. Multi-unit properties (2-4 units) and manufactured homes historically have higher default rates, so Fannie Mae sets lower LTV limits and sometimes higher credit requirements for these. Condos and co-ops carry project risk (e.g. if the building has structural or financial issues), so Fannie requires condo/co-op project reviews and limits certain high-LTV or high-risk transactions in those. For example, investment property loans on co-op units or condo-hotel units are not allowed ￼. Manufactured homes can depreciate or be more vulnerable to damage, so Fannie caps LTV (often 95% max for primary residence purchase, lower for others) and requires the home meet specific standards (like at least 12 feet wide, 600 sq. ft minimum, etc. per Selling Guide B2-3-02) ￼. By delineating property types, Fannie Mae can tailor eligibility: e.g. a 4-unit property is allowed for a primary residence, but max 75% LTV and the borrower must have experience or strong reserves due to the complexity of managing rental units. Some property types like condotels, timeshares, or agricultural (farm) properties are ineligible because they carry illiquidity or non-residential use risks. Ultimately, ensuring the property is standard residential housing that holds its value underpins the collateral risk management for Fannie Mae.

Thresholds & Constraints: Key property-type-related rules:
	•	Units: Fannie Mae permits up to 4-unit residential properties. More than 4 units is considered commercial/multifamily and is not allowed. LTV limits drop as unit count rises (see Rule 1). For example, a 2-unit primary home purchase max 85% LTV, 3-4 unit max 75% ￼. Also, borrowers purchasing 3-4 unit homes need higher reserves (typically 6 months) and sometimes a minimum credit score (e.g. 680+) because they’ll be landlord for rental units ￼ ￼.
	•	Condominiums: Condo units must be in Fannie-eligible projects. This means the condo association’s financials, insurance, and occupancy ratios must meet standards (per Guide B4-2). Certain high-LTV transactions on condos require a “Limited Review” which in turn has stricter LTV limits (e.g. in a high-rise condo or an investment condo, max LTV might be 75% on Limited Review). For full eligibility, condos in litigation or with high investor concentration can be ineligible. Pricing engines often ask “Is this a condo?” because some loan programs add pricing adjustments for condos or have slightly lower max LTV for condos (for instance, some lenders overlay a 5% LTV reduction on condos in certain markets).
	•	Co-ops: Co-operative units are allowed in certain states (e.g. NY, IL, DC etc.) where co-op financing is common. Co-ops have their own project review guidelines. Notably, Fannie does not allow investment or second home cash-out refinances on co-ops ￼ (they must be primary or limited cash-out if second home). Also, co-ops must be in approved states and typically require higher borrower equity (many co-ops have underlying mortgages and stricter LTV limits).
	•	Manufactured Homes: Must be built on a permanent chassis to HUD code, titled as real property (with the land), and meet Selling Guide B2-3-02 requirements (size, age, foundation). Fannie’s standard program allows up to 95% LTV for manufactured home purchase (if it’s a MH Advantage certified home with specific features, up to 97%). For manufactured homes, a minimum credit score often applies (e.g. 660) and max 45% DTI. Also, all manufactured home loans must go through DU (no manual underwriting) ￼. Many pricing engines have a checkbox for “Manufactured Home” – if checked, they will filter out products that don’t allow it or apply pricing adjustments (Fannie charges an LLPA for manufactured housing, typically 0.50%–1.00% depending on LTV ￼ ￼).
	•	Others: PUDs (Planned Unit Developments) are generally treated like single-family homes; just the HOA info needs to be collected, but Fannie doesn’t usually limit LTV for PUDs. Mixed-Use: The property can have a minor business use (e.g. storefront with apartment) if it’s primarily residential (income-producing use limited to 25% of floor area), otherwise not eligible. Unique properties: Log homes, dome homes, etc., can be accepted if there are comparable sales to establish value ￼ ￼, but they may face extra scrutiny or lender overlays. Ineligible properties include: vacant land, properties with >20 acres (some exceptions), boarding houses, bed & breakfast, condotels, co-ops in resort areas, and any property without permanent utilities or that is not suitable for year-round occupancy.

Formula/Calculation: There is no numeric formula for property type, but in underwriting systems this is often a categorical input that triggers specific rules. For example, one could use logic:

property_type = "Condo"  # e.g. "Single Family", "2-Unit", "Condo", "Co-op", "Manufactured"
occupancy = "Investment"
LTV = 0.80

eligible = True
# Simple rule checks:
if property_type == "Manufactured":
    if LTV > 0.95 or occupancy == "Investment":
        eligible = False
if property_type == "Co-op":
    if occupancy == "Investment":
        eligible = False  # Fannie does not allow investment co-op
# ... more rules ...

print("Eligible property/type combination" if eligible else "Ineligible for Fannie Mae")

The above is a simplification; in reality, the AUS and pricing engine apply a matrix of rules. For instance, for a condo, DU will require a condo review. If the loan is a Limited Review (based on LTV and occupancy), it will ensure LTV is within the limit (e.g. DU will issue an “Ineligible” if you try a Limited Review on a condo at 95% LTV, because the limit for limited review on owner-occupied condos is 90%).

Pricing Engine Implementation: In Optimal Blue, Property Type is a critical filter. Lenders maintain separate product codes or adjustments for condos, co-ops, manufactured homes, etc. For example, a lender might have a “Conv 30-Year Fixed” product that is only for 1-unit, site-built homes and condos, and a separate “Conv 30-Year Manufactured” product code for manufactured housing (with pricing adjustments built in). If the user selects “Property Type: Manufactured Home” in OB, only programs that allow manufactured homes will be shown. Similarly, if “Condo” is selected, the engine might automatically add the applicable LLPA (Fannie Mae charges a 0.75% LLPA for condos in some LTV tiers ￼) to the pricing. Encompass and DU also capture property type: DU Findings will explicitly state if the property type is a condo or manufactured home and list conditions (e.g. “Project review required for condo” or “Property is a manufactured home – ensure property meets all requirements”). Pricing engines also enforce special requirements: e.g. if “Co-op” is chosen, many investors only allow co-ops in certain states – the engine will apply those eligibility rules. If an ineligible combination is selected (say “Investment” + “Co-op”), OB would likely return “No eligible products” or an error, because as noted Fannie and most investors don’t allow investment co-ops ￼. In summary, property type affects both eligibility (some products won’t allow certain types or will cap LTV) and pricing (via LLPAs or separate pricing for higher-risk property types). Lenders use the PPE to automatically handle these distinctions, ensuring the loan is priced on the correct adjustments or not shown if the property is not allowed.

5. Occupancy Type (Primary Residence, Second Home, Investment Property)

Definition: Occupancy type refers to how the borrower will use the property: as a Primary Residence (owner-occupied principal residence), a Second Home (owner-occupied vacation or secondary residence), or an Investment Property (not occupied by the owner, used for rental or investment purposes). Fannie Mae distinguishes these because risk and guidelines differ. A primary residence is where the borrower lives most of the year; it can be 1–4 units (with the borrower occupying one unit). A second home is typically a 1-unit property, occupied by the borrower some portion of the year, usually in a vacation area or similar – it cannot be a multi-unit property (a 2-unit “second home” is considered an investment by Fannie) ￼. Second homes cannot be subject to a rental agreement (though occasional short-term renting is tolerated, they are primarily for borrower’s use). Investment properties are any 1-4 unit properties that the borrower does not occupy – these are bought to rent out or hold for investment. Occupancy type is declared on the loan application and is a key underwriting parameter. Misrepresenting occupancy (saying a home will be primary when it’s actually an investment) is a serious violation (occupancy fraud) because guidelines are more lenient for primary homes.

Purpose & Risk Logic: Occupancy is a major risk factor: Historically, borrowers are far more likely to default on investment properties or second homes than on their primary residence (which they live in). Thus, Fannie Mae imposes stricter LTV limits, higher credit score requirements, and higher pricing adjustments on non-owner occupied properties. For example, maximum LTV for a 1-unit investment purchase is 75-85% (depending on factors) compared to 95-97% for a 1-unit primary ￼. Second homes, while still owner-occupied, are also riskier than primary (borrowers in financial stress will pay their main home first), so Fannie caps second home LTV at 90% and does not allow second homes to be multi-unit or co-ops in certain cases ￼. Pricing-wise, LLPAs for investment properties are significantly higher (reflecting the added risk). Additionally, Fannie Mae limits how many financed properties a borrower can have (see Rule 10) – that primarily comes into play for second homes and investments, since one can only have one primary. Occupancy also affects reserve requirements: investment property purchases require more months of reserves than primary home purchases ￼. Overall, by differentiating occupancy, Fannie Mae aligns loan terms with risk – primary homes get the most favorable terms, second homes moderate, and investments the most conservative terms.

Thresholds & Constraints: Major occupancy-based rules:
	•	Primary Residence: At least one borrower must intend to occupy the property as their principal residence within 60 days of closing (Fannie’s requirement for owner-occupancy). Primary residences can be 1–4 unit. They enjoy highest LTV allowances (up to 97%) and lowest credit score requirements (620). They also allow more flexibility in underwriting (higher DTI with DU, etc.). Many Fannie programs and charter obligations are geared to primary residences.
	•	Second Home: Must be a one-unit dwelling, suitable for year-round occupancy, and the borrower must have exclusive control (can’t be a timeshare or subject to rental pools) ￼ ￼. Only one second home per borrower is generally allowed at a time (though not an official rule, it’s rare to have multiple “second” homes unless they truly use them). Second homes cannot be 2-4 units – if it’s 2-4 units and the borrower won’t occupy all units, it’s treated as investment ￼. Fannie Mae typically requires 10% down (90% LTV max) on second home purchases ￼. Cash-out refinances on second homes are limited to 75% LTV. Also, if a second home is being purchased and the borrower does not currently own a primary, some lenders ask for documentation of current housing (to ensure it’s genuinely a second home and the borrower isn’t claiming “second home” to get a better deal on what is actually their primary). Pricing: second homes have an LLPA (e.g. 1.125% fee at some LTVs) ￼ but not as high as investments.
	•	Investment Property: Can be 1–4 units. No owner occupancy. Max LTV for 1-unit investment purchase ~85% (if DU approval and strong file) but Fannie’s matrix currently shows 75% max for many investment scenarios ￼. 2-4 unit investment max 75% or lower. Investments always carry additional LLPAs (e.g. a 1-unit investment loan has a 2.125% LLPA at 75% LTV even with 740+ credit, and more if lower credit ￼). If a borrower is buying an investment property, Fannie requires at least 6 months of reserves for that property, plus additional reserves for other properties ￼. Also, if the borrower already has a primary and maybe a second home, the new purchase is clearly investment. As occupancy type, “Investor” loans must qualify with the potential rental income (with limitations – Fannie will allow using projected market rent with a 25% vacancy factor in some cases to help qualify, but only if borrower has landlord experience or certain conditions).
	•	Occupancy Fraud Prevention: Lenders typically require an “Occupancy Affidavit” at closing. If a loan is delivered as primary or second home and Fannie determines the borrower never occupied as stated, the loan could be subject to repurchase. Pricing engines and DU don’t directly police this beyond the data input, but lenders will look at factors (distance between current and new home, etc.) to ensure occupancy claim makes sense (e.g. someone buying a “second home” in the same city where they rent – that’s a red flag, likely it’s actually an investment rental).

Formula/Calculation: Not a numeric formula, but business rules. A simplified decision logic example:

occupancy = "Second Home"  # "Primary", "Second Home", "Investment"
units = 2
LTV = 0.90

if occupancy == "Second Home" and units > 1:
    print("Ineligible: second home must be a 1-unit property [oai_citation:95‡selling-guide.fanniemae.com](https://selling-guide.fanniemae.com/sel/b2-1.1-01/occupancy-types#:~:text=Second%20Home%20Properties%20%3B%20is,exclusive%20control%20over%20the).")
elif occupancy == "Investment" and LTV > 0.85:
    print("Ineligible: LTV too high for investment property.")
# ...

This pseudo-code flags a 2-unit second home as ineligible (since Fannie would treat that as investment) ￼.

Pricing Engine Implementation: In Optimal Blue, occupancy is an input that dramatically filters products and sets adjustments. When a user selects “Occupancy: Investment,” OB will include the higher rate adjustments for investment properties (or separate investor-specific product if defined). Many lenders have separate pricing grids for “Primary Residence” vs “Investment” even under the same program. OB also might restrict certain LTVs based on occupancy – for instance, if you try to price a 90% LTV loan and select “Investment,” OB knows that exceeds Fannie’s max LTV, so it may return no pricing or flag it as not meeting guidelines. Similarly, if “Second Home” is chosen, OB will enforce the 1-unit rule by requiring the property type to be 1-unit (some engines explicitly ask property type and occupancy together to ensure valid combos). Encompass passes occupancy info to DU and the PPE. DU findings will stipulate the occupancy and apply respective rules (e.g. “Investment Property – Max 15-year term for 2-4 unit” in some cases, etc.). Also, pricing engines apply LLPA matrix based on occupancy: e.g. as of 2024, Fannie has an LLPA of 2.375% for investment properties at certain LTV/credit ranges ￼, and 0.625% for second homes at 75% LTV ￼. These are automatically added to the pricing when the occupancy field is set. If a program doesn’t allow second homes or investments (for example, some first-time homebuyer programs are primary only), the PPE will filter those out when occupancy is set to second/investor. In summary, the occupancy field in pricing/underwriting systems ensures the loan is evaluated under the correct rules: it gates allowable LTV, requires certain reserve and credit criteria, and triggers appropriate pricing adjustments.

6. Loan Purpose (Purchase, Limited Cash-Out Refinance, Cash-Out Refinance)

Definition: Loan purpose categorizes the transaction as a Purchase, Limited Cash-Out Refinance (LCOR) (often called “rate-term” or “no cash-out” refi), or Cash-Out Refinance. A purchase money mortgage finances a home acquisition. A limited cash-out refinance replaces an existing loan (or finances a property owned free and clear) with a new loan at equal or lower balance, allowing only “incidental” cash back (the lesser of 2% or $2,000) ￼. LCOR can include closing costs and can pay off a first mortgage and possibly subordinate liens that were used to purchase the home. A cash-out refinance is any refinance that gives the borrower cash beyond the above incidental limit – essentially tapping equity. Cash-out also applies if the borrower hasn’t owned the property for a required seasoning period (e.g. doing a refi too soon after purchase might be deemed cash-out unless it meets the “delayed financing exception”). Fannie Mae distinguishes these purposes because their risk profiles differ: cash-out indicates higher risk (the borrower is increasing debt or taking equity out), so guidelines are stricter.

Purpose & Risk Logic: Purchases are viewed as less risky since the loan is enabling homeownership and typically the borrower is bringing in down payment. Rate-term refis often lower the borrower’s payment or interest rate, which can improve stability. Cash-out refis, however, increase the borrower’s debt and have historically higher default rates – borrowers might be consolidating debt or extracting equity, which could indicate financial stress or leave less equity as a cushion. Therefore, Fannie Mae limits cash-out refinances to lower LTVs and requires longer ownership seasoning. For example, max LTV for cash-out on a primary 1-unit is 80% ￼ (versus 97% on a purchase). For 2-4 unit or investment, cash-out max LTV is even lower (75% or less). Additionally, Fannie’s Selling Guide requires the borrower to have owned the property for at least 6 months before a cash-out refinance (to prevent property flipping or quick equity take-out) ￼, with a few exceptions (inheritance, delayed financing if they bought with cash, etc.) ￼ ￼. Limited cash-out refinances have slightly higher max LTV than cash-out (for example, up to 95% LTV on a primary LCOR if it’s a Fannie Mae-to-Fannie Mae refinance under certain programs). The risk logic: ensure the borrower has “skin in the game” when taking equity (cash-out) and to prevent churn of refinances unless there’s net tangible benefit.

Thresholds & Constraints: Notable rules by purpose:
	•	Purchase: Allows highest LTVs (up to 97% for certain first-time buyer programs) ￼. If LTV > 95% on a standard purchase, at least one borrower must be a first-time homebuyer ￼. The borrower’s down payment can come from various sources (subject to minimum own funds if high LTV on 2-4 unit or investment). Pricing engines might apply special pricing for purchases (some lenders give slightly better pricing on purchases vs refis). Also, some LLPAs differ: e.g. Fannie’s LLPA matrix has separate grids for purchase, LCOR, and cash-out ￼.
	•	Limited Cash-Out Refinance (Rate/Term): The existing loan being refinanced must be paid off. Cash back to the borrower at closing is limited to $2,000 or 2% of the new loan, whichever is less ￼. No seasoning requirement as long as borrower is on title (except if they just purchased with cash, there’s the “delayed financing” exception allowing immediate refi as rate-term). LCOR can be used to refinance a first mortgage and subordinate liens that were used to purchase the property (or paid off seasoned liens), but if any subordinate lien was taken as cash-out previously, rolling it in might make it a cash-out refi. Max LTV for LCOR is generally the same as purchase for owner-occupied (up to 95% on a 1-unit primary if it’s a Fannie Mae loan being refinanced, or 97% for special high-LTV refi programs when available) – but note: high-LTV refi options above 95% were a special program (RefiNow or high-LTV refi) that currently is limited ￼. For rentals and second homes, max LTV on LCOR is lower (e.g. 90% on a second home LCOR, 75% on investment LCOR).
	•	Cash-Out Refinance: Strictest LTVs – 80% max for 1-unit primary ￼, 75% for 2-4 unit primary, 75% for second home, 70-75% for investment property (per Eligibility Matrix) ￼. Ownership seasoning: at least one borrower must have been on title for ≥6 months prior to loan disbursement to do a cash-out ￼. (If less, it’s only allowed under the “delayed financing” exception: if they bought the home for cash recently, they can do immediate cash-out up to purchase price with documentation ￼.) Also, if the property was a gift or inherited within 6 months, that’s an exception. There is no 6-month wait for rate/term refis – that seasoning is specifically for cash-out. Cash-out refinances also require more reserves in many cases (e.g. if DTI > 45% on a cash-out, 6 months reserves are required) ￼. Fannie’s guide also prohibits cash-out refinances on properties listed for sale in the last 6 months (unless borrower certifies they needed to refinance instead of sell). And if the property was purchased via 1031 exchange, there are limits on cash-out for a period. Cash-out proceeds can be used for any purpose (debt consolidation, home improvement, etc.), but the loan must make sense (“Net Tangible Benefit” tests are applied by lenders to meet ability-to-repay expectations even though for Fannie it’s not explicitly required). For investment properties, Fannie expects a borrower to already own the property for a while before pulling equity (and there is a cap of 10 financed properties regardless – see Rule 10).

Formula/Calculation: Logic example – determine if a refinance is cash-out or not:

original_loan_balance = 300000
new_loan_amount = 320000
closing_costs = 5000
cash_to_borrower = new_loan_amount - original_loan_balance - closing_costs

if cash_to_borrower > 0:
    purpose = "Cash-Out Refinance"
else:
    # If cash_to_borrower is minimal (<=2% or $2000), it's LCOR
    if cash_to_borrower <= max(0.02 * new_loan_amount, 2000):
        purpose = "Limited Cash-Out Refinance"
    else:
        purpose = "Cash-Out Refinance"
print(purpose, f"Cash back: ${cash_to_borrower:.0f}")

If this prints “Cash-Out Refinance” with cash back $15,000, we know it’s equity-out. If it was “Limited Cash-Out Refinance Cash back: $0” then it’s just covering existing loan and costs. Note the 2%/$2K rule: if the borrower ends up with a few hundred dollars overpayments from rounding, it’s still LCOR.

Pricing Engine Implementation: Loan purpose is a crucial field in pricing. Optimal Blue will have separate pricing grids for purchase, rate-term refi, and cash-out refi. Fannie Mae’s LLPA matrix differentiates purpose: for example, a loan with 740 FICO/75% LTV has a 0.250% LLPA on a purchase, 0.500% on a no-cash-out refi, and 1.000% on a cash-out refi ￼. The PPE applies these accordingly when you select the purpose. Many investors also impose adjustments or have different max loan-to-value by purpose – OB knows to restrict the LTV input based on purpose (e.g. if user selects “Cash-Out” and inputs 90% LTV, the engine will likely flag ineligibility for conforming). Encompass similarly captures purpose: when submitting to DU, the correct purpose must be selected (DU has specific underwriting for RefiNow program if applicable, etc.). DU findings will explicitly say “Cash-Out Refinance – Ineligible” if the LTV or other factors don’t meet guides, or it will list the max allowable LTV for that purpose. Another example: if the property was acquired <6 months ago and user tries to do cash-out, DU will likely give an Ineligible (unless the delayed financing exception is applied by inputting the right data). Pricing engines may not catch the title seasoning issue (that’s more an underwriting condition), but some lender overlays in OB might require a 6-month seasoning for cash-out and would reject if not met. When comparing offers, a user will see higher rates for cash-out refis than for purchases, reflecting both LLPAs and often lender-specific pricing hits. Also, certain products like RefiNow (a low-income refinance option) are only for no-cash-out refinances; OB will only show those if purpose = rate/term and if other criteria match. In summary, the purpose field directs the PPE to the correct pricing matrix and eligibility rules. Lenders and engines enforce that cash-out refis stay within LTV limits and meet seasoning: e.g. an engine might ask “Date acquired?” for a cash-out – if less than 6 months, it might prompt, “Not eligible for cash-out per Fannie Mae guidelines ￼.”

7. Loan Amount Limits (Conforming vs. High-Balance)

Definition: Fannie Mae sets conforming loan limits each year – the maximum loan size it will purchase, varying by property unit count and location. The standard baseline conforming loan limit for a one-unit property in 2025 is $806,500 ￼ ￼. This limit increases for multi-unit properties (e.g. ~$1,033,200 for 2-unit, $1,244,850 for 3-unit, $1,546,200 for 4-unit in 2025) and in designated high-cost areas it can go up to 150% of the baseline (for 1-unit, $1,209,750 maximum in high-cost counties) ￼. Loans at or below these limits are Conforming loans. Loans above are “jumbo” and not eligible for Fannie Mae (except under specific programs like some refinancing of existing Fannie loans, but generally Fannie does not buy loans above the limit). However, loans between the baseline and the high-cost maximum in high-cost counties are often called Conforming High-Balance or “Super Conforming” loans – Fannie Mae will purchase these but treats them with slightly different underwriting and pricing. For example, a $1 million loan on a single-family home in Los Angeles (a high-cost area) is within the high-balance limit and Fannie-eligible, whereas a $1 million loan in a low-cost area far exceeds the $806,500 limit and is not eligible. The loan limits are determined by FHFA and adjust annually based on home price indices ￼.

Purpose & Risk Logic: Loan size correlates to risk because larger loans expose Fannie Mae to more loss in a default. Also, very high loan amounts historically were associated with luxury properties which may have different marketability. By charter, Fannie Mae cannot purchase loans above the set limits (with narrow exceptions). The creation of high-cost area limits acknowledges that in some regions (e.g. coastal metro areas) median home prices are higher, so moderately higher loan amounts are allowed to promote liquidity there. However, high-balance loans often carry slightly stricter underwriting: Fannie typically requires higher minimum credit scores or lower DTIs for high-balance, and DU handles them slightly separately. For instance, prior to 2022, high-balance loans required 700 minimum FICO in some cases; Fannie has eased some of those, but LLPAs for high-balance remain (they have their own LLPA matrix add-on). There’s also a limit on combined loans: you cannot split a loan into two to circumvent the limit (Fannie has rules against “piggyback” structures solely to avoid jumbo – though 80-10-10 piggybacks are allowed to avoid MI, they still check the first lien is within limit). By enforcing loan limits, Fannie Mae stays within its mandate and leaves very large loans to the private/jumbo market. Additionally, loan limits protect against concentration of very large loans in the portfolio.

Thresholds & Constraints: For 2025 (as an example year):
	•	One-Unit Limit: $806,500 baseline across most of the U.S. ￼. In high-cost counties, up to $1,209,750 ￼. Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, USVI have special statutory limits at the high-cost ceiling for even 1-unit (so $1,209,750) ￼.
	•	Two-Unit Limit: Baseline ~$1,033,200; high-cost ~$1,550,000 (approx, 150% of baseline – actual values are set by formula and rounding).
	•	Three-Unit: Baseline ~$1,244,850; high-cost ~$1,867,000.
	•	Four-Unit: Baseline ~$1,546,200; high-cost ~$2,319,000.
	•	These increase every year if home prices rise (the formula is based on FHFA HPI; 2025 saw a 5.2% increase from 2024) ￼.
	•	High-Balance Underwriting: High-balance (any loan above the baseline but at or below high-cost limit) usually must be submitted to DU – Fannie requires DU approval for high-balance loans ￼. Manual underwriting of high-balance loans is generally not allowed or heavily restricted. Also, the Eligibility Matrix often has separate columns for high-balance: e.g. max LTV for a high-balance 2-unit might be 85% (vs 85% for conforming – sometimes the same, but certain combinations might differ).
	•	Loan Amount Floor: There’s typically no minimum loan amount for Fannie (aside from practical considerations, a $50k loan could be sold but many lenders have a $~50k or $75k min because small loans have high relative costs).
	•	If the loan amount exceeds the limit for the property’s county and unit count, it is ineligible for Fannie Mae purchase. For example, a $900k one-unit loan in a county with $800k limit is not conforming. Pricing engines will categorize that as “Jumbo” and not show conforming products.
	•	Note: Fannie also has special products (HomeReady, etc.) but those still adhere to same loan limits.

Formula/Calculation: There’s no formula for the limits themselves (they are published values). But one could check eligibility by comparing the loan amount to the limit for the given scenario:

loan_amount = 900_000
units = 1
is_high_cost_area = False

# Example limit lookup (simplified):
base_limit_1_unit = 806500
high_cost_limit_1_unit = 1209750

if units == 1:
    limit = high_cost_limit_1_unit if is_high_cost_area else base_limit_1_unit
elif units == 2:
    limit = (high_cost_limit_1_unit * 1.283) if is_high_cost_area else (base_limit_1_unit * 1.283)
# (The actual multipliers are set by FHFA; e.g., ~1.283 for 2-unit, etc.)
# ...

if loan_amount <= limit:
    print("Conforming loan – eligible by size.")
else:
    print("Loan amount exceeds Fannie Mae limits – jumbo/ineligible.")

In this example, $900k on a 1-unit in a non-high-cost area would print “exceeds limits” because limit is $806,500. In a high-cost area, limit would be $1.20975M, so it would be eligible.

Pricing Engine Implementation: Optimal Blue requires the loan amount and the property’s state/county (or a high-balance flag). It will automatically determine if the loan is conforming, high-balance, or jumbo based on that. If the loan amount is above the general limit, OB will see if the zip code is in a high-cost county and if the amount is <= that county’s limit. If not, conforming products won’t show. If yes, it will show high-balance conforming pricing (which often carries a rate add-on). Fannie Mae’s LLPA matrix has specific fees for high-balance loans (e.g. as of 2024, a high-balance loan adds 0.25% to 0.75% depending on LTV) ￼. The engine will include those when pricing a high-balance scenario. In Encompass, when you input the property address or FIPS code, it can automatically populate the county loan limit (there’s usually a “Lookup” for loan limits). Encompass/DU will also issue messages if a loan is high-balance: e.g. “Loan amount exceeds standard conforming limit; casefile underwritten as high-balance.” Additionally, DU requires a special code for high-balance delivery (SFC 808 for high-balance ARM, etc., but that’s on the backend). Pricing engines might have separate products for “Conforming Fixed 30” and “High-Balance Fixed 30,” or a single product that adjusts based on loan amount. Lenders often treat high-balance loans with slightly higher rates due to loan-level price adjustments and potentially higher capital requirements. If a user mistakenly inputs a loan amount above allowed, OB will likely show zero products or indicate the max loan amount for that program. For example, “Max loan $X for this product” or simply not display conforming 30-year pricing if the loan is clearly jumbo. In summary, loan amount is an essential input: pricing/eligibility systems ensure the loan amount doesn’t exceed Fannie Mae limits for the given property and location, and classify it as normal conforming or high-balance (applying any required adjustments) accordingly. As an aside, the 2025 increase to $806,500 baseline means engines had to update those values – being up-to-date on limits is critical (OB usually updates immediately when FHFA announces, as we saw an announcement on 11/26/2024 for 2025 limits ￼).

8. Mortgage Insurance (MI) Requirements for High LTV Loans

Definition: Fannie Mae requires private mortgage insurance (PMI) on conventional loans that exceed 80% LTV. This insurance protects the lender/investor (Fannie Mae) against a portion of losses if the borrower defaults, since high-LTV loans have less borrower equity. The standard MI coverage is defined by LTV and loan term. For example, on a 90–95% LTV 30-year loan, standard PMI coverage is 30% of the loan (meaning the insurer covers that top 30% of loss) ￼. At 85–90% LTV, standard coverage is 25%; at 80.01–85% it’s 12% ￼. Fannie also allows reduced (minimum) MI coverage options for some loans, with an LLPA adjustment – for instance, a lender can choose 16% coverage instead of 30% at 95% LTV, but then Fannie charges a pricing hit (the “Minimum MI” LLPA) ￼ ￼. Loans with LTV ≤ 80% do not require MI. Mortgage insurance can be borrower-paid monthly, single premium, or lender-paid, as long as it meets Fannie’s coverage requirements. MI must be provided by an approved insurer.

Purpose & Risk Logic: MI shifts risk of high-LTV loans to a third-party (the mortgage insurer) and reduces Fannie Mae’s exposure to loss. If a borrower defaults on a 95% LTV loan, Fannie might only face 70% of the loss if 30% coverage MI pays out, significantly mitigating the severity. Therefore, Fannie Mae’s Selling Guide mandates MI for LTV > 80% as a counterparty risk management strategy (per its Charter, Fannie actually must have credit enhancement on loans above 80% LTV). The required coverage percentages are calibrated so that loans with MI have similar loss risk to an 80% LTV loan. The “minimum MI” option (lower coverage with LLPA) basically allows the lender/borrower to trade off insurance coverage for upfront fee – Fannie still prices for the higher risk by charging an LLPA ￼. From a borrower perspective, MI allows them to purchase with less down payment. From Fannie’s perspective, MI is essential for high-LTV loan eligibility: a 95% LTV loan with no MI is not purchasable (unless it’s part of a special program like a charter exception or lender recourse). MI companies also impose their own underwriting (they might decline insurance on a risky loan, which in turn makes it ineligible for Fannie). So MI adds a layer of risk oversight. Mortgage insurance cancelation: per Homeowners Protection Act, MI can drop off when LTV goes below ~78% via amortization or a new appraisal, but initially it must be in place.

Thresholds & Constraints: Key MI requirements:
	•	Loans > 80% LTV: Must have MI coverage that meets or exceeds Fannie Mae’s standard coverage matrix ￼. For fixed-rate terms > 20 years (most 30-year loans), standard coverage is: 12% for >80–85% LTV, 25% for >85–90%, 30% for >90–95%, 35% for >95–97% ￼. For 20-year or shorter terms, required coverage is lower (e.g. 25% instead of 35% at >95% LTV) ￼. HomeReady (an affordable program) permits even lower coverage (25% at >90% LTV) with an LLPA credit given to incentivize it ￼.
	•	Acceptable MI Forms: Borrower-paid monthly is most common. Single-premium or lender-paid are allowed as long as coverage percent is met (lender-paid MI basically means the loan’s interest rate is higher to cover MI). Financed MI (adding a single premium to the loan) is allowed; Fannie has guidelines how to adjust LTV for financed MI (the LTV for eligibility is calculated on the base loan without MI, but the loan with MI can exceed 97% as long as base LTV is within limit).
	•	MI Companies: Must be approved by Fannie Mae (there is a list of approved insurers meeting certain ratings/capital). If an MI company fails (as some did in 2008), Fannie has backup arrangements but that’s an extreme scenario.
	•	Loans with 2nd Trust (Combo loans): If the first lien is ≤80% LTV and a second lien is taking the combined LTV higher, MI is not required on the first lien (that’s a common way to avoid MI – an “80-10-10” structure). Fannie Mae allows that structure as long as CLTV ≤ 95% (or 90% for some programs) ￼. So MI is strictly based on the first lien LTV.
	•	Cancellation: Not directly an eligibility issue, but Fannie requires servicers to cancel MI at 78% LTV amortization or if requested at 80% with good payment history (per HPA). This doesn’t affect loan delivery, but it affects how MI coverage can eventually drop off.
	•	High-LTV Refi Programs: Some special refi programs (HARP in the past, HIRO later) allowed transferring MI or proceeding without MI if original loan didn’t have it despite being high-LTV (certain HARP refis let LTV > 80 without new MI if the old loan didn’t have MI). But those were specific to refinancing existing Fannie loans and are not part of standard eligibility going forward (HIRO was suspended) ￼.

Formula: To compute required MI coverage: it’s a percentage of the loan amount. E.g., on a $200,000 loan at 90% LTV (purchase price $222k), standard required coverage is 25%. That means $50,000 coverage (in event of default, insurer pays up to $50k loss). Python example:

LTV = 0.90
loan = 200000
# Determine standard MI coverage
if 0.80 < LTV <= 0.85:
    cov = 0.12
elif LTV <= 0.90:
    cov = 0.25
elif LTV <= 0.95:
    cov = 0.30
elif LTV <= 0.97:
    cov = 0.35
else:
    cov = 0.00  # No MI required if <=80%
coverage_amount = cov * loan
print(f"Required MI Coverage: {cov*100:.0f}% which is ${coverage_amount:.0f}")

For 90% LTV, this prints “Required MI Coverage: 25% which is $50000”. If lender opted for “minimum MI” (say 12% at 90% LTV), that would reduce monthly MI premium but Fannie charges an LLPA for the shortfall (and in fact Fannie’s matrix indicates an LLPA for each tier of reduced coverage) ￼.

Pricing Engine Implementation: Mortgage insurance is usually handled outside of base pricing by the PPE, but it critically affects APR and payment which PPEs display. In Optimal Blue, after you choose a loan product, it will prompt for MI selection if LTV > 80. Users can compare MI types (monthly vs single premium, etc.) and OB can include the MI in the total monthly payment calculation. However, the presence of MI also has upstream effects: some loan programs (like certain lender portfolio products) might not allow lender-paid MI, etc. For conforming loans, OB doesn’t restrict high-LTV outputs as long as MI is obtained. But it does ensure compliance: if you input 95% LTV and don’t select any MI, the engine will typically default to adding monthly MI to the quote, because otherwise the loan is not deliverable. Also, pricing engines incorporate Fannie’s LLPA for minimum MI if applicable – e.g. if a lender chooses to do a 90% LTV loan with only 12% coverage (min MI), OB will add the LLPA (which might be 0.25% or similar) to the pricing of that loan ￼. Encompass, when preparing the loan for delivery, will require entry of MI information (MI company, certificate #, coverage percent, etc.) for loans >80% LTV. If you tried to deliver a 95% LTV loan without MI coverage data, Fannie’s systems would reject it. DU also checks MI: DU findings will say “Mortgage insurance is required for LTV > 80%” and even list the required coverage percentage. If you run DU with an LTV > 80, it assumes standard MI by default for risk assessment. Some DU special cases: if the loan is HomeReady with <= 80% AMI borrower, DU knows reduced MI (25% at 97% LTV) is allowed and will apply the LLPA credit of 0.125% in the risk assessment ￼. Pricing engines help loan officers by showing MI premium quotes (from MI company integrations or a rate card). For example, OB might say “Monthly MI = $150” for a given scenario, affecting the DTI. Another aspect: If doing Lender-Paid MI (LPMI), the pricing engine will adjust the interest rate higher (because the lender’s paying a single premium to MI). OB allows users to compare scenarios with borrower-paid vs lender-paid MI. In all cases, the engine ensures that any scenario with LTV > 80 has either MI or is flagged as ineligible. Some loans, like those with an 80/10/10 piggyback, will have 80% LTV first with no MI; OB would show no MI needed if CLTV is 90% but first is 80%. The engine might ask for CLTV and HCLTV to confirm subordinate financing instead. In summary, mortgage insurance is a conditional requirement tied to LTV: the PPE and LOS will enforce that condition by requiring MI on high-LTV conforming loans and incorporating its cost and any pricing adjustments (e.g. LLPA for lower coverage or credit for certain affordable loans) into the loan’s pricing and compliance checks.

9. Reserve Requirements (Cash Reserves / Post-Closing Liquidity)

Definition: Reserves refer to the amount of liquid or near-liquid assets a borrower retains after closing, measured in months of the housing payment (PITIA). In underwriting, reserves indicate the borrower’s cushion to handle financial stress or emergencies. Fannie Mae’s Selling Guide specifies minimum reserve requirements for certain transactions based on occupancy, property type, and risk factors. For example, a 2-4 unit primary residence or an investment property purchase has explicit reserve requirements (often 6 months) ￼. Reserves are calculated as the borrower’s eligible liquid assets remaining after down payment and closing costs, expressed in number of monthly payments that amount could cover ￼. If multiple properties are owned, Fannie also requires reserves for those other properties (since those represent additional obligations). The Eligibility Matrix includes columns for “Minimum Reserves (months)” for various scenarios. For instance, a 1-unit primary purchase might require 0-2 months reserves (depending on DU or manual), whereas an investment property may require 6 months for that property plus additional per other property ￼ ￼.

Purpose & Risk Logic: Reserves provide a buffer if the borrower’s income is interrupted or expenses rise. They are a strong risk mitigator – borrowers with more post-closing savings are less likely to default. Therefore, Fannie Mae uses reserve requirements to offset higher risk situations. Higher risk factors = more reserves required. Examples: High DTI loans (especially >45%) often need extra reserves ￼; multi-unit and investment properties inherently have unpredictable expenses or potential vacancy, so Fannie wants borrowers to have significant savings to cover those. Borrowers with multiple financed properties must demonstrate they aren’t stretched too thin by showing reserves for each additional property ￼ ￼. Even when DU doesn’t explicitly “require” reserves for an Approve, having zero reserves might affect DU’s risk assessment. But if DU requires or the matrix requires a certain amount, it’s mandatory. Also, manual underwriting sets specific reserve minimums in many cases. Requiring reserves ensures the borrower isn’t depleting all assets for closing – they have an emergency fund to handle job loss, vacancies, maintenance, etc. Particularly for investment properties, Fannie Mae knows that if the renter stops paying, the borrower needs some savings to cover the mortgage. Thus, reserves are critical for sustainability of the loan.

Thresholds & Constraints: Key reserve requirements:
	•	Primary Residence, 1-unit: DU does not impose a generic reserve requirement for most 1-unit owner-occupied loans if risk factors are low (and none is required by the Selling Guide for many standard scenarios) ￼. Many such loans can close with 0-2 months of reserves. However, if DU’s risk analysis finds it needs compensating factors (like high DTI or borderline credit), DU may require reserves in the Findings. For manual underwriting, the Eligibility Matrix might require e.g. 2 months on a 95% LTV 1-unit purchase if credit is lower. But generally 1-unit primary has the least reserve requirement.
	•	2-4 Unit Primary: Fannie Mae explicitly requires 6 months of PITIA in reserves for 2–4 unit owner-occupied properties ￼. This is because the borrower is reliant on rental income from other units; if that income ceases, they need cushion. (If DU Approve is given with less, the Selling Guide still mandates 6 months as a minimum for 2-4 unit primary, per B3-6, so lenders will enforce it).
	•	Second Home: Typically requires 2 months reserves (at least) after closing ￼. If the DU risk is higher, it might ask for more. But the guide explicitly lists 2 months for second home transactions as a baseline ￼.
	•	Investment Property: Requires 6 months reserves for the subject property at a minimum ￼. Additionally, if the borrower has other financed properties, see next point.
	•	Multiple Financed Properties: If the borrower will have multiple financed homes (second homes or investments in addition to their primary), Fannie Mae requires extra reserves for those other properties. The rule is: 2% of the unpaid principal balance (UPB) of all other financed properties if the total financed properties count is 1–4; 4% of UPB if 5–6 properties; 6% of UPB if 7–10 properties ￼. This calculated dollar amount is then divided by the subject PITIA to equate to some number of months (but lenders usually just ensure the dollar amount in assets is there). For example, if a borrower owns 3 rentals with $300k total balances and is buying a 4th, and subject PITIA is $2k, 2% of $300k = $6k, which is 3 months of the subject payment – so effectively +3 months reserves in that case. These additional reserves are on top of the subject property’s own reserve requirement ￼ ￼.
	•	High DTI or Cash-Out: As noted, if DTI > 45% on a cash-out refinance, Fannie requires 6 months reserves (for DU loans) ￼ ￼. Also, manually underwritten high DTIs require more reserves per the matrix. DU itself may conditionally require reserves if it finds it needs them (DU could say “X months reserves required” in findings).
	•	LTV/credit impact: While not directly stated as formula, often risk layering triggers reserve needs. E.g. a marginal credit score with high LTV might get a DU approval only if some reserves are present. Fannie doesn’t publicly detail DU’s reserve logic (that’s part of its model), but lenders see that having 3-6 months reserves often flips a DU from Refer to Approve on tight scenarios.
	•	Documentation of reserves: Assets must be liquid per Selling Guide (checking, savings, stocks, vested retirement (with haircut if under retirement age, usually 60% value counted), etc.) ￼ ￼. Importantly, equity in other property or illiquid assets (like a car) don’t count as reserves. Large cash deposits need sourcing as usual. The formula for months of reserves = (liquid assets after closing) / (monthly PITIA). Lenders will verify this before closing.

Formula/Calculation: A quick check for reserves sufficiency:

monthly_PITIA = 2500  # new housing payment
required_reserves_months = 6
liquid_assets_after_closing = 16000

required_dollars = required_reserves_months * monthly_PITIA
if liquid_assets_after_closing >= required_dollars:
    print("Reserves requirement met")
else:
    shortage = required_dollars - liquid_assets_after_closing
    print(f"Reserves insufficient by ${shortage:.0f}")

If this prints reserves met, the borrower had at least $15k in this example (6 * $2500 = $15k). If not, loan might need more assets or would be ineligible. For multiple properties: one would sum other loans’ balances and apply 2/4/6%. For example:

other_financed_UPB = 500000  # total balances on other properties
num_financed_props = 5  # including subject
if num_financed_props-1 <= 4:
    addl_reserve_pct = 0.02
elif num_financed_props-1 <= 6:
    addl_reserve_pct = 0.04
else:
    addl_reserve_pct = 0.06
additional_reserves_needed = other_financed_UPB * addl_reserve_pct
print(f"Additional reserves (for other properties): ${additional_reserves_needed:.0f}")

Say $500k UPB on other properties and 5 financed properties total => addl 4% = $20k needed ￼. The borrower would need that $20k plus the subject 6 months etc. DU automates this calculation and will tell the lender total asset requirement.

Pricing Engine Implementation: Reserves themselves do not directly affect pricing (no LLPA for having more or less reserves). However, reserves affect eligibility in underwriting. Pricing engines might not explicitly ask “How much reserves?” because that’s more of an underwriting detail than a pricing input. Typically, OB assumes if a scenario is being priced, the LO will ensure reserves are met. However, some product guidelines in OB might indirectly require reserves, especially for non-QM or jumbo products where the engine could list a guideline: “Requires 6 months reserves.” It’s then on the user to ensure that’s satisfied. For conforming loans, OB doesn’t prevent pricing if reserves are lacking, since DU could still approve if other factors compensate. But if a scenario clearly requires reserves (like an investment property purchase), a good LOS/PPE integration might prompt the user to input available assets to ensure it meets reserve requirements. Encompass DU integration will take the asset information and if reserves are insufficient, DU findings will come back “Approve/Ineligible” or “Refer” with a message like “Insufficient reserves, X months required” ￼. Loan officers using pricing engines generally assume that if DU approves, reserves are okay, so the pricing engine’s role is minimal here. That said, some PPEs allow credit risk overlays – for example, a lender could choose not to show pricing for a borderline DU Approve if reserves are < 2 months, etc. But that would be a custom overlay. In summary, while reserves are critical for underwriting, pricing engines handle them mostly in the background. The LOS, underwriter, or DU handles verification. One place the PPE/LOS might flag reserves is in multiple property scenarios: Encompass has a “Net Real Estate Owned” schedule; if a borrower owns other rentals, the system might automatically calculate required reserves per Fannie’s formula and alert if assets are insufficient. Also, when the loan is delivered, Fannie’s delivery system expects the lender to represent that reserve requirements per the Matrix are met ￼. Pricing engines don’t deliver that data, but they can include an alert: e.g. “Note: 6 months reserves required for this investment property – ensure assets verified.” This helps the LO structure the deal appropriately (maybe the borrower can’t do the loan if they only have 2 months saved). Thus, reserves don’t change the rate/price, but they are a prerequisite for eligibility that all systems down the line must account for.

10. Number of Financed Properties

Definition: This rule limits how many properties a borrower can have financed with mortgages at one time when obtaining a new conventional loan. Fannie Mae will finance up to 10 properties for one borrower (including their primary) ￼, but imposes extra restrictions as that number increases. If the subject loan is a second home or investment property and the borrower already has multiple mortgages, Fannie’s guidelines in B2-2-03 come into play. Notably, for loans on investment or second home properties, if the borrower has 1–6 financed properties in total, standard eligibility can apply; if they have 7–10 financed properties, Fannie Mae still allows the loan only via DU (no manual) and requires a 720 minimum credit score, 6 months reserves for each additional property, and other strict criteria ￼. Fannie will not purchase a new investment/second home loan if it would put the borrower over 10 financed properties. (Loans on primary residences are excluded from the count limit for primaries, but they still count toward the total when doing another loan.) Importantly, the financed property count includes the subject property and all other 1-4 unit residential properties where the borrower is obligated on a mortgage (even if jointly) ￼. It does not include real estate that is free and clear or commercial/multifamily properties ￼. The rule is often stated as “Maximum 10 financed properties, with additional constraints when >6.”

Purpose & Risk Logic: The more properties a borrower has financed, the more exposure they have to vacancies, maintenance costs, and economic swings – essentially, they are an investor with a large portfolio. Data shows that borrowers with multiple mortgages have higher correlated default risk (if something like a recession hits, it can affect all their rental incomes at once). By capping at 10, Fannie Mae limits excessive exposure to individual investors, aligning with its mission to support housing for owners and small investors, not to finance unlimited real estate empires. The stepped requirements (like 720 FICO for 7-10 properties and hefty reserves) ensure that only very strong borrowers with substantial experience and liquidity get those high counts ￼. Also, requiring DU for 7-10 financed properties means the automated risk assessment must explicitly clear that risk – no manual override. The policy also mitigates concentration risk and encourages prudent lending – a borrower with 15 houses might be better served by commercial financing or other channels. In summary, this rule prevents an over-leveraged situation where one borrower’s potential default could involve many properties at once.

Thresholds & Constraints: Fannie’s rules here can be summarized:
	•	No set limit for primary residence loans: If the borrower is buying a new primary residence, Fannie Mae doesn’t impose a strict count limit (they could technically have 4 rentals already and still get a primary loan – that’s fine). However, those rentals count towards the overall count if the new loan is not a primary. For HomeReady (a low-income program), there’s a limit of 2 financed properties for the occupant (to ensure they are truly in need of affordable options) ￼.
	•	Max 10: If the new loan is for a second home or investment, Fannie allows a max of 10 financed properties including the new one ￼. Many lenders overlay a max of 6 or 8, but Fannie’s policy is 10 for DU loans. (Manually underwritten loans are more limited: often only 6 total are allowed manually – in fact, Fannie’s matrix disallows >6 financed properties for manually underwritten, since 7-10 is DU-only) ￼.
	•	Additional Requirements for 5-10: Actually, Fannie differentiates at 7. Specifically, 1–6 financed properties: standard eligibility (min credit per matrix, reserves per matrix) ￼. 7–10 financed properties: allowed only on one-unit second home or investment purchases/refis (no 7-10 if the subject is multi-unit or if it’s a cash-out on a multi-unit? – the matrix notes sometimes restrict certain high count scenarios), minimum credit score 720 is mandated ￼, and additional 6% reserves on aggregate UPB (as per Rule 9 calculation) ￼. Also, for 7-10 financed, LTV might be capped at 70% on purchases and 60% on refis by the matrix (this was an older requirement; recent matrices may allow higher, but historically Fannie capped LTV 70% for 7-10).
	•	Exclusions from count: The borrower’s primary counts as a financed property if it has a mortgage, for the purposes of counting to 10 ￼. Properties financed solely in a non-borrowing spouse’s name might not count if the spouse isn’t on the new loan (Guide says “the cumulative total for all borrowers” – if one borrower has 3 and co-borrower has 2 separate, together they count as 5) ￼. Commercial properties (5+ units, or land, etc.) are not counted ￼. Also, if a borrower owns a property free and clear (no financing), it’s not counted as “financed” (though note, taxes/insurance on it still must be counted in DTI as obligations if applicable).
	•	Multiple loans to one borrower in a short time: If a borrower is buying lots of properties at once, each loan application will consider the others. Fannie allows simultaneous second home/investment transactions, but the same reserves can cover both as long as each meets its requirement independently (they don’t require double counting of the same money) ￼ ￼.
	•	Delivery requirement: Lenders must deliver a special code SFC 150 if the borrower has >6 financed properties, to flag it to Fannie. Pricing-wise, Fannie actually had an LLPA in the past for 7-10 financed properties (e.g. 0.25% fee), but currently that was folded into the general LLPA by occupancy and credit.

Formula/Calculation: Counting financed properties logically:

borrower_financed_props = 7
co_borrower_financed_props = 0
total_financed = borrower_financed_props  # assume co-borrower properties are either joint or separate
# If co-borrower has separate financed properties not in borrower's count:
total_financed += co_borrower_financed_props

if total_financed > 10:
    eligibility = "Ineligible – exceeds 10 financed property limit"
elif total_financed > 6:
    # Must be DU and meet 720 score etc.
    eligibility = "Eligible (DU only) with 720+ credit and extra reserves"
else:
    eligibility = "Eligible under standard rules"
print(f"Financed Properties: {total_financed} -> {eligibility}")

For example, if this prints “Financed Properties: 7 -> Eligible (DU only) with 720+ credit and extra reserves,” the underwriter knows to check those additional requirements.

Pricing Engine Implementation: The number of financed properties is not directly a pricing input in most consumer-facing PPEs, but it is an important underwriting input. DU has a field for “Number of Financed Properties” which lenders must fill accurately ￼. If left blank, DU will infer from the REO section or credit report ￼. Pricing engines don’t charge more for a borrower with 8 houses versus 2 houses (no direct LLPAs differ now), but product eligibility can be affected. Many lenders impose overlays like “Max 4 financed properties for second homes/investments” (especially smaller lenders or certain investor programs). If so, Optimal Blue would have that in the product guidelines – if the LO knows the borrower has e.g. 5 properties financed and tries to price with a lender who caps at 4, OB might either exclude that lender’s product or show an alert like “Overlay: Borrower has >4 properties financed, ineligible.” However, for Fannie’s core guideline of max 10, most lenders follow it, so typically OB assumes anything ≤10 is fine for conforming pricing. Encompass will capture in the 1003 how many REOs the borrower has and whether there are mortgages on them (via liabilities and REO schedule). Encompass or DU will then generate a message if count > 6: “Borrower has X financed properties; loan casefile meets Fannie Mae eligibility only if credit score ≥ 720 and reserves per B3-4.1-01 are met ￼.” The LO should then ensure the pricing scenario uses a credit score of 720+ or else the DU will come back Refer/Ineligible. Pricing engines could indirectly reflect this: e.g., if a user put credit 700 and 7 financed properties, OB might not catch that the 720 rule is failing – that’s more on DU to catch. Some sophisticated PPE integrations might warn, but generally this is a gray area where the loan officer/underwriter must know the guideline. There is no specific LLPA for >6 properties now (previously there was a minor one that got eliminated in 2010s). Therefore, the pricing output for a borrower with 3 rentals versus 8 rentals will look the same in OB (assuming credit, LTV, etc., are the same). It’s just that the 8 rentals scenario will have more conditions to satisfy. Lenders often have internal eligibility checks outside OB – e.g. their loan origination system might block moving to closing if DU finds more financed properties than allowed by an overlay. In summary, while “# of financed properties” is not usually an input for quoting a rate, it is very much tracked in underwriting. Pricing engines may include it in guideline fine print, but it’s primarily DU that enforces the limits. Loan officers need to supply that info to DU (OB could allow a notes field but it doesn’t price off it). Thus, this rule is a good example of one that matters in approval eligibility but not directly in pricing adjustments. The integration point is that DU will issue an “Approve/Ineligible” if a loan is submitted not meeting the multiple property rules (for instance, manual underwriting or credit score too low for 7 properties), and that will force the LO to adjust the scenario (maybe reduce number of properties by removing someone from obligation, or choose a different financing strategy).

11. Income Documentation Type (Full Doc, Alternative, Non-QM)

Definition: This refers to the level of documentation of income used to underwrite the loan. Full Documentation is the standard for Fannie Mae: it means verifying income via standard means (pay stubs, W-2s, tax returns, etc., as required by the type of income) ￼. Fannie Mae’s Selling Guide has very specific documentation requirements for various income types (e.g. salaried requires recent paystub and W-2; self-employed requires 1-2 years tax returns and maybe a year-to-date profit/loss; rental income requires leases/tax schedule E, etc.). Alternative documentation in a Fannie context might mean something like one year of documentation instead of two (which DU can allow for stable self-employment) or third-party verifications (like using a vendor’s verification of employment (VOE) in lieu of paystubs). However, Non-QM types of documentation (such as bank statement loans, stated income, no-income loans) are not allowed for Fannie Mae sales – those are purely offered by non-agency lenders. So, for Fannie Mae eligibility, essentially full documentation per the Selling Guide is required for all income used to qualify. Fannie Mae does not buy “stated income” loans (since the ATR rule and after 2008). The only exceptions are certain limited documentation programs within the guide, like DU’s validation service (which verifies income through sources like The Work Number – but that’s still full doc, just electronically verified), or some streamlined refinances where income documentation can be waived if DU accepts (e.g., high LTV refi programs might waive income in some cases). So from an eligibility perspective, any loan delivered to Fannie must either have been run through DU (which ensures full doc or allowed doc waivers) or be manually underwritten to full doc standards.

Purpose & Risk Logic: Proper income documentation is fundamental to ensuring the borrower can repay the loan (Ability-to-Repay rule compliance and general sound underwriting). Loans with insufficient documentation historically had much higher default rates (no-doc loans in the mid-2000s defaulted at alarming rates). Fannie Mae requires documentation to verify that the income is stable, sufficient, and likely to continue ￼. The Selling Guide’s income documentation rules (Section B3-3) cover everything from employment verification to tax return analysis, which ensures a consistent approach to determine qualifying income. By disallowing non-traditional doc like bank statement programs or “asset depletion” (except as specified in guide), Fannie keeps its loans within the Qualified Mortgage (QM) box, avoiding the legal and credit risk of not verifying income. That said, Fannie does allow some flexibility: for example, if DU approves, sometimes only one year of tax returns for self-employed can be used (if the business is stable and LTV < 75%, etc.). Or for borrowers with long history, DU might not require VVOE (verbal verification) prior to close if the situation meets Day 1 Certainty guidelines. But fundamentally, Fannie’s requirement is that every income source used to qualify must be verified and documented according to the Guide ￼. Non-QM loans (like those using only asset depletion or debt-service coverage ratio with no personal income, etc.) cannot be sold to Fannie – they are typically kept in portfolio or sold to private investors.

Thresholds & Constraints: Highlights regarding documentation:
	•	Standard Documentation (Full Doc): For employment income: recent 30 days of pay stubs and 2 years W-2s (or 1 year if DU says 1 is acceptable) ￼. For self-employed: 1-2 years personal and business tax returns (DU may allow 1 year if certain criteria) and a year-to-date profit/loss if older than a quarter, plus verification the business is active (phone listing, etc.) ￼ ￼. For assets used as income (like asset depletion under Fannie’s asset-as-income rules), must document assets and then follow guide formula (Fannie does allow certain asset depletion formulas for retirement assets for income). For rental: lease agreements and evidence of rent (or Schedule E). Fannie also has Verification of Employment (VOE) alternatives: e.g. a written VOE from employer plus one paystub can suffice in some cases if it includes needed info ￼. Also, DU’s Income Validation (Day 1 Certainty) can waive documentation if the data is verified from employers/tax transcripts.
	•	No Income Doc / Non-QM: Loans with no income verification (e.g. “stated income”) are not eligible. Every loan must either get a DU Approve (which means DU found sufficient income info) or be manually underwritten with full doc. Thus, non-QM products like interest-only loans with bank statements for income or no-doc investor loans (DSCR loans that qualify only on property cash flow) cannot be delivered to Fannie. Those are explicitly excluded – Fannie’s Selling Guide doesn’t have provisions for not collecting income documentation (aside from special refi programs where DU waives it).
	•	Limited Doc Refi Programs: Some Fannie programs (like RefiNow, or earlier HARP) waive certain documentation if the benefit is proven. For instance, RefiNow (for low-income borrowers refi) still requires income documentation but can use non-traditional like year-end paystub plus letter. HARP in the past allowed some borrowers to not provide income if they had a clean mortgage history – but that program ended. Currently, Fannie’s refi programs still require income documentation to ensure ATR.
	•	Employment gaps, variable income: Fannie sets documentation to address these: e.g. need 2-year history for bonus income, etc. If a borrower can’t document according to guide (say they changed to self-employed last year and only have 6 months of that income), that income often can’t be used at all.
	•	Non-employment income: like Social Security, disability, retirement – needs award letters, proof of continuation (if applicable), etc. Alimony/child support needs court orders and proof of receipt. All of that is spelled out in Selling Guide and must be followed.
	•	Lender’s responsibility: Fannie’s guidelines are minimums; lender can require more. But at delivery, lender attests the income was obtained and verified. Under representation and warranty relief (Day 1 Certainty), if DU validates income with third-party data (like an automated employment verification), the lender gets relief from rep/warrant on that income documentation ￼ – but they still had to get that data from DU’s vendors.

Formula/Calculation: N/A in a numeric sense. But an example: verifying income via an API vs documents. For example, in code one might check income like:

income = 6000  # monthly income from docs
dti_ratio = total_debt / income

The source of that income must be documented. If not, the underwriting fails. Perhaps a pseudo-check:

income_docs_provided = ["W2_2022", "Paystubs_Aug2025"]
if "W2_2022" in income_docs_provided and "Paystubs_Aug2025" in income_docs_provided:
    income_verified = True
else:
    income_verified = False
print("Income fully documented" if income_verified else "Insufficient income documentation")

In reality, lenders use software (OCR or manual) to verify they have all required documents. DU outputs messages like “Income verified via DU validation service” or “Provide YTD pay stub and W2” etc.

Pricing Engine Implementation: Generally, pricing engines do not have a toggle for “documentation type” for conforming loans – because it’s assumed to be full doc. (In contrast, for Non-QM products, PPEs might allow selection of “bank statement program” or “DSCR program,” which are different products entirely.) For conforming, if a borrower can’t qualify full doc, you wouldn’t price it through Fannie Mae’s channel at all – you’d switch to a Non-QM product which the PPE would treat as a different program. So within the context of Fannie Mae eligibility, there’s effectively only one documentation standard: standard full doc. That said, Optimal Blue does have fields like “Income Documentation: Full/Alt/Stated” but those are usually relevant to FHA or Non-QM. If you choose anything other than “Full” for a conventional loan, OB likely will filter out Fannie products, because Fannie doesn’t allow alt-doc. For example, OB might categorize a “12-month bank statement program” under a Non-QM investor’s offerings, not under Fannie. Encompass and DU require you to input all income and asset data; there is no option to do a Fannie loan without income. If one were to try to run DU with no income listed, DU would fail ATR/QM and not approve (except possibly a scenario of a no-income asset depletion which would still need input in a different way). So pricing engines basically assume full documentation. The only slight nuance is the Day 1 Certainty aspect: OB or Encompass might show a note “DU Validation available for income – if validated, no paystubs needed” but that doesn’t change pricing or eligibility, it’s just a process improvement. On the flip side, Non-QM products in the engine explicitly ask for doc type (e.g. 24-month bank statements, or DSCR) because their pricing and guidelines vary by doc type. But those are not Fannie Mae loans. If a loan officer has a borrower whose income can’t be documented to Fannie standards, they likely won’t even attempt to price it with conforming lenders in OB; they’ll switch to searching Non-QM lenders in OB with “Documentation Type: Bank Statement” filter, for instance. So from a Fannie perspective, the documentation requirement is binary: either you meet it and you get a Fannie rate, or you don’t and Fannie is not an option. Lenders also categorize loans as QM (Qualified Mortgage) or non-QM in their systems; all Fannie-eligible loans are QM by definition or via the GSE patch. Encompass will flag if something might be non-QM (e.g. DTI > 43 and not DU approved after patch expiration, etc.). But as of now, loans approved by DU are considered QM under the GSE patch (extended indefinitely by CFPB), so documentation is part of that. In summary, the pricing engine doesn’t adjust price for documentation on conforming – it’s an eligibility switch. Any selection other than full documentation is basically taking you out of the conforming product set. Therefore, lenders and PPEs treat Fannie loans as full-doc only, and any other doc types funnel to other investor options. One could say OB “enforces” full doc by simply not offering a field for conventional loans to choose stated or bank statements. And if a user marks something odd (like leaving income blank or putting very high DTI), DU/Encompass will catch it, not OB’s pricing logic. The loan either qualifies or not, and pricing only applies if it’s within the full doc conforming realm.

12. Property Condition and Appraisal Acceptability

Definition: The subject property must meet Fannie Mae’s minimum property standards and the appraisal must be acceptable. Property condition is rated by appraisers with standardized codes: C1 (new/excellent) to C6 (severe deficiencies). Fannie Mae requires properties to be at least in “C4” condition or better – that means no major issues that affect safety, soundness, or structural integrity. Properties appraised with condition ratings C5 or C6 are not eligible until repaired ￼. Essentially, C5/C6 indicate substantial damage or deferred maintenance (e.g. foundation problems, leaking roof, inadequate heating, etc.). If an appraisal shows C5/C6, the lender must get those issues cured and a final appraisal update showing improvement to C4 or better before delivery ￼. Appraisal acceptability also extends to the type of property and the appraisal’s validity: the appraisal must be performed by a licensed appraiser, use appropriate comparable sales, and support the opinion of market value. Certain property types or features can make the property ineligible or require additional steps – e.g. properties with mixed-use, properties with solar panels on leases, unique homes, or homes on large acreage may be acceptable only if the appraisal shows sufficient comps and the residential nature of value. Fannie also has project standards for condos/co-ops (the appraisal must note if a condo project meets criteria or if certain project review is needed). Another aspect is appraisal waivers: For some low-LTV or refi loans, DU may offer a Value Acceptance (previously called PIW) where an appraisal is not required. But if an appraisal is obtained in such cases, it must still meet standards. Essentially, Fannie’s guide section B4 details property eligibility and appraisal guidelines to ensure the collateral is adequate. Unacceptable collateral examples: properties with severe structural issues, properties not readily accessible by roads, or those that are not primarily residential (e.g. a working farm with income-producing farm use might be ineligible).

Purpose & Risk Logic: The property is the loan’s collateral, so its condition and marketability are crucial. Fannie Mae will not lend on properties that are unsafe or unsound because they may not hold value or be habitable (leading borrowers to default). Also, homes needing major repairs could imply the borrower might face large expenses post-closing that could impair repayment ability. Requiring at least C4 condition (which is “Average” condition, no severe deficiencies) ensures the home is livable and typical for the market ￼. If the appraisal indicates repairs are needed (“subject to repairs” appraisal), those repairs must be done prior to loan delivery. Fannie’s refusal of C5/C6 is explicit: “Properties with a condition rating of C5 or C6 are not acceptable collateral to secure a mortgage sold to Fannie Mae unless repaired to C4” ￼. Similarly, the appraisal itself must be performed to standard (Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice and Fannie’s own requirements). If an appraisal is sloppy or has unsupported adjustments, Fannie can issue a repurchase. They have Collateral Underwriter (CU) to assess appraisal quality. Additionally, certain riskier property features (e.g. an underground storage tank, or non-permitted additions) can affect acceptability. From a risk view: if an appraisal overvalues the property or misses a defect, Fannie is lending more than the home is truly worth. So they impose guidelines to ensure the appraisal is accurate and the property is typical, marketable, and insurable. Post Surfside condo collapse, for instance, Fannie issued guidance requiring condo appraisers/HOAs to comment on structural issues or deferred maintenance in projects – because a condo with a failing structure is not acceptable. All of this protects Fannie Mae from collateral that could precipitously lose value or be unsellable.

Thresholds & Constraints: Key points:
	•	No C5/C6 Conditions: As stated, if the appraisal’s overall condition rating is C5 or C6 (meaning significant deficiencies like leaks, substantial damage, etc.), the loan is ineligible until those items are fixed and the rating upgraded ￼. The appraiser can make the appraisal “subject to repairs” to reach C4, in which case the lender must get evidence of completion. Common required repairs: peeling lead paint (for older homes, even though that’s more an FHA focus, safety issues must be fixed), missing utilities, active roof leaks, broken HVAC, etc.
	•	Soundness and Structural Integrity: Any “physical deficiencies or conditions that impact safety, soundness, or structural integrity” must be repaired ￼. E.g. foundation problems, mold, termite damage (significant), etc. Minor deferred maintenance (like worn carpet, old roofing but not leaking) might still be C4 and acceptable.
	•	Appraisal Standards: The appraisal must use appropriate comps (similar size, style, etc. ideally within 1 mile and recent sales) – if not, the appraiser must explain. It must include the required exhibits (photos of subject and comps, street map, building sketch, etc.). Fannie uses the Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) – the appraiser’s condition and quality ratings (Q1–Q6 for quality) are critical. If an appraisal has contradictory info or seems not credible, Fannie (or the lender) may reject it. They also will not accept appraisals with certain conditions like “subject to” without evidence of completion, or if the appraiser notes an adverse condition and lender doesn’t address it.
	•	Unpermitted additions: Fannie now has some flexibility if an addition is unpermitted but typical and safe (lender discretion if value can be supported). But major unpermitted or non-compliant use can be an issue.
	•	Property types not allowed: e.g. a property used for commercial enterprise (even if residential structure) beyond what is allowed for mixed-use. Or a unit in a condo-hotel or timeshare, etc., are ineligible.
	•	Appraisal Waivers: If DU offers a waiver (for certain low-LTV refinances or if there’s a prior appraisal on file), then no appraisal is needed. This is acceptable as long as DU specifically says “Value Acceptance” – that is as “acceptable” as an appraisal to Fannie (they’re taking data from prior deals). But if a waiver is accepted, the property’s condition is assumed to be okay by virtue of previous data/loan performance. If the LO orders an appraisal anyway (despite a waiver), the lender must use it – they can’t ignore a poor appraisal in favor of a waiver.
	•	Condo/Co-op Project Issues: If an appraisal or project review indicates the project has significant deferred maintenance (like failed safety inspections, etc.), the unit becomes ineligible (per temporary condo guidelines). This relates to condition acceptability on a project scale.
	•	Repairs and Escrows: Fannie generally doesn’t allow escrowing funds for completion after closing except minor items not affecting habitability (like landscaping or exterior paint in winter) – any health/safety repairs must be done before closing. So property must essentially be move-in ready.

Formula/Calculation: Not numeric, but one might interpret LTV cushion for condition risk. For example, if a property is C5 and appraised at $250k as-is vs $270k after $20k repairs, Fannie says do the $20k repairs first. No direct formula; it’s a pass/fail on condition quality.

An algorithmic way to think of appraisal acceptability:

appraisal_condition = "C5"
appraisal_quality = "Q4"
structural_issues = True  # appraiser noted foundation crack

if appraisal_condition in ["C5", "C6"] or structural_issues:
    acceptability = "Not Eligible until repairs done (property condition unacceptable) [oai_citation:196‡truistsellerguide.com](https://www.truistsellerguide.com/manual/cor/general/1.07Appraisals.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Properties%20with%20a%20condition,See%20%E2%80%9CPhysical)."
else:
    acceptability = "Property meets minimum condition."
print(acceptability)

If condition is C5 or C6 or severe issues flagged, the output would reflect not eligible. The appraised value might also be questioned if comps are far or adjustments huge, but that’s harder to quantify algorithmically (Fannie’s Collateral Underwriter gives a risk score 1-5 to flag appraisal quality concerns).

Pricing Engine Implementation: Pricing engines generally do not incorporate property condition directly – they assume the property is acceptable. However, they may indirectly incorporate appraisal type: e.g., if a loan qualifies for an appraisal waiver, that might save the borrower cost but doesn’t change pricing (except some lenders have slight LLPA waivers if no appraisal needed). If a property has issues, it’s more of an underwriting problem than pricing. Encompass will have fields from the appraisal (condition rating, etc.), but OB doesn’t ask “Is the property C5?” because if it were, the loan shouldn’t proceed to pricing until fixed. Instead, identifying property condition issues happens during underwriting, not at rate quote stage. What PPEs might reflect: if a property is unique (log home, etc.), some lenders might not lend on it – but that is usually handled via an exclusion in their guidelines, not a pricing adjustment. Possibly a lender’s guide says “No log homes” – OB would then filter out that lender if property type was indicated as log (though OB doesn’t have a log home checkbox typically; that’s a manual guideline check). For appraisal waivers (PIWs), some pricing engines allow the LO to indicate if they have a PIW. That doesn’t change the base price, but some investors charge a fee or give a credit for appraisal waivers. Actually, Fannie itself doesn’t charge for PIW. But some lenders might reflect faster closing or one less fee, but rate is same. Encompass, when running DU, will tell the user if a PIW is offered. The LO can then choose to accept it (no appraisal needed) – that saves time/money but not something that OB explicitly prices.
One relevant thing: if a loan needed a HomeStyle Renovation (to fix a C5 property) or is a manufactured home needing specific appraisal, then you’d price a different product (HomeStyle loans have different pricing, and not all lenders offer them). OB would require selecting the appropriate product type if doing a renovation loan. If an appraised value comes in lower, the LTV might go up, which affects pricing – but that’s indirect.
So, in practice, property condition issues are handled in underwriting and closing, often after rate lock. If major issues are found, either the borrower fixes them (maybe with a price renegotiation or seller concessions) or the loan can’t close – that would mean the rate quote doesn’t matter because the deal is off.
In summary, pricing engines assume the collateral meets Fannie criteria. There isn’t a condition adjustment except possibly if you switch loan programs (like to a renovation loan with higher pricing if the property needs work). The onus is on the appraiser and underwriter to ensure acceptability. Lenders, however, may price in some risk via LLPA: Fannie’s LLPA matrix does have a 0.25% hit for “Manufactured home” or 0.75% for “Condo” etc. If a property is C3 vs C4 – no price difference as long as it’s eligible. If it’s C5 – it’s a no-go until fixed.
Thus, the integration is: DU/underwriting will issue conditions: e.g., “Appraisal indicates C5 – not eligible until repaired” ￼, the loan can’t be delivered, the LO may have to extend the lock (which could cost a extension fee), but pricing engine isn’t directly involved in that. Some LOS systems might track that required repairs escrow or re-inspection fees may influence APR, but that’s minor.
So while property condition is critical for loan eligibility, it doesn’t change the pricing aside from possibly requiring a different product type (like renovation loan) if you go that route. Pricing engines do have products for HomeStyle Renovation, which are separate and priced higher due to additional risk/overhead – an LO might pivot to that product if the buyer wants to close and then renovate a C5 property. OB would then price a HomeStyle loan which includes the repair escrow. But if they want a standard loan, they must get the property to C4 first, then pricing remains as quoted.

13. AUS Findings and Manual Underwriting Thresholds

Definition: This refers to the role of Automated Underwriting System (AUS) – specifically Fannie Mae’s Desktop Underwriter (DU) – findings versus manual underwriting guidelines, and the thresholds that determine if a loan can be approved by DU or must meet manual criteria. DU Findings are the result of running the loan through the algorithm; they come back as Approve/Eligible, Approve/Ineligible, Refer with Caution, etc. Manual underwriting means the loan is assessed by a human underwriter using Fannie’s published manual guidelines (primarily if DU cannot issue an Approve). Certain loans cannot be scored by DU (or get a Refer) and then must meet stricter manual limits. Fannie Mae’s Selling Guide and Eligibility Matrix outline those manual underwriting requirements (lower DTIs, higher reserves, etc.). Generally, DU approval is preferred – it can allow higher DTIs (up to 50%) and some flexibility that manual doesn’t. If a loan is Approve/Eligible, it meets both DU’s risk standards and Fannie’s guidelines. If it’s Approve/Ineligible, DU found the credit risk acceptable but some guideline (like LTV or number of properties) is outside parameters ￼ ￼. Refer (or “Error”/“Out of scope”) means DU cannot approve it, so manual underwriting might be an option if within manual limits. Key thresholds: DTI 45% (manual cap vs DU 50%), credit 620 (manual min vs DU no min recently), and LTV/score combos per the matrix for manual.

Purpose & Risk Logic: Fannie Mae relies on DU to streamline and improve risk assessment. DU’s algorithm can consider multiple risk factors in combination and may approve loans that a simple manual check might not (e.g. a borrower with 50% DTI but very high credit and lots of reserves might get DU Approve, whereas manually that DTI is too high). The AUS findings indicate if the loan is within Fannie’s credit risk tolerance. When DU gives an “Approve/Eligible,” it offers representation and warranty relief on certain aspects and the lender can proceed knowing Fannie will accept the loan (assuming data is correct and verified). If a loan falls outside DU’s acceptance (e.g. complex self-employment with insufficient data for DU, or no credit score scenario), a manual underwrite must use conservative thresholds, as outlined in the Selling Guide’s manual matrices ￼. This ensures that without DU’s model, the loan is only done if it’s clearly low risk by traditional standards. For example, manual underwriting typically requires DTI <= 36% (or 45% with compensating factors) ￼, and multiple months of reserves and maybe 2 years of income stability. These stricter thresholds mitigate risk because the nuanced risk layering DU does can’t be replicated manually easily. The interplay: if DU finds a combination outside of its “current acquisition preferences”, it might return Approve/Ineligible (meaning risk is okay but a policy is not met, or it’s outside some constraint) ￼. Lenders then have to either adjust the loan to meet guidelines or not do it unless they have some variance. Also, certain loans must be manual (if DU doesn’t support them, like some unique scenarios), and they must fit manual criteria or they’re not done. Ultimately, Fannie Mae’s risk management says: trust DU for most cases, but enforce absolute caps for manual deals to limit risk when DU isn’t there to assess. AUS findings essentially trump manual guidelines when present – if DU approves a scenario that manual wouldn’t (like 50% DTI), it’s okay because DU considered comp factors. But if DU cannot approve, manual is fallback with strict limits.

Thresholds & Constraints:
	•	DU “Approve/Eligible”: This means loan meets Selling Guide eligibility (LTV, etc.) and credit risk is acceptable. Lenders can follow DU’s streamline requirements (like no need for full manual comp factor analysis). They must still verify the data DU used (income, assets, etc.). If DU says “Eligible,” it meets Fannie’s criteria. If “Approve/Ineligible,” DU liked the credit risk but some guideline is unmet.
	•	Approve/Ineligible: Common reasons might be: LTV exceeds limit, or loan is to be delivered as high-balance but something is off, or number of financed properties > allowed for the occupancy, etc. DU will list the reason. Lender can then decide if that can be fixed (e.g. lower LTV) or if perhaps they have a contract variance with Fannie to allow it ￼ ￼. Alternatively, they could manually underwrite if the issue is something manual guidelines can accommodate. But usually if DU says ineligible for a specific guideline, manual won’t circumvent that because Guide is Guide. The Selling Guide explicitly says Approve/Ineligible can be eligible for sale only if either the lender has a specific variance or if they manually underwrite and meet all manual criteria for the product ￼.
	•	Refer (Caution): DU might give a “Refer with Caution” for high risk or if the data fails checks. Those loans are not eligible for Fannie Mae (they’re basically a denial from DU). Manual underwriting cannot save a Refer with Caution – it indicates the credit risk is too high or doesn’t meet Fannie’s minimums.
	•	Manual Underwriting Caps: If a loan is manually underwritten (maybe borrower has no credit score, or DU is down, or DU gave an Approve/Ineligible but manual criteria can be applied), the Eligibility Matrix outlines the maximum LTV, min credit, max DTI 36/45% etc. for manual ￼. For example, a manually underwritten one-unit primary purchase requires 620+ credit if <= 75% LTV, or 640/680 if higher LTV, and DTI <= 36% (or 45% if credit is above a threshold and reserves are higher) ￼ ￼. If any compensating factor is lacking, max 36% DTI. Manual loans also require more reserves in many cases (e.g. 2 months minimum even if DU might not have needed any).
	•	When Manual is Allowed: Some scenarios require manual by guide: e.g. if borrowers have nontraditional credit only (no credit score), that’s manual. Those have very strict limits: max 90% LTV, DTI 36% etc. Also, HomeReady loans with boarder income or something DU might not handle fully may need manual. But by and large, >95% of loans go through DU and get Approve.
	•	AUS versus Manual Pricing: Not directly different in price from Fannie’s perspective – but manual underwrites often are done for marginal borrowers, which might have hits (like lower credit, etc., which do reflect in pricing). Also, some lenders simply will not do manual underwrites on conventionals because of risk (no DU rep & warrant relief). Some will, but possibly charge higher fees or adjust rate a bit (although Fannie doesn’t have an official LLPA for manual, lenders might overlay).

Formula/Calculation: The decision logic:

du_recommendation = "Approve/Ineligible"  # possible values: Approve/Eligible, Approve/Ineligible, Refer
if du_recommendation == "Approve/Eligible":
    result = "Proceed with DU Approved loan under DU terms."
elif du_recommendation == "Approve/Ineligible":
    result = "Not eligible via DU guide; check if issue can be fixed or manual criteria allows."
elif du_recommendation == "Refer":
    result = "High risk - not eligible for Fannie Mae (manual won’t help)."
else:
    result = "Manual Underwrite needed – apply manual guidelines."
print(result)

For example, Approve/Ineligible might occur if, say, the loan had 51% DTI – DU could say Approve/Ineligible (if the limit is 50% in system). The lender might manually underwrite to see if they can push DTI down or if, maybe if DTI 51% but everything else great, manual still cannot approve because 45% is max. So in that case it’s just ineligible. Another scenario: Approve/Ineligible because, say, the loan is a condo in a project that DU doesn’t have data for – maybe manual project review can clear it. Or Approve/Ineligible because the LTV is slightly above matrix for the property type – manual won’t override Fannie’s LTV limits though.

Pricing Engine Implementation: Pricing engines usually don’t differentiate AUS approval versus manual in pricing – they assume the loan will get approved (that’s why you’re pricing it). However, some lenders have pricing adjustments or policy if a loan is manually underwritten. Typically, Fannie doesn’t charge more for manual, but lenders might consider them riskier (no DU rep/warrant relief on income, etc.). It’s not common to see a specific pricing hit for “manual” on conforming loans, but some lenders simply disallow manual underwrites except maybe for very strong borrowers or specific situations. In Optimal Blue, there isn’t a toggle for DU or manual for conforming loans – OB assumes it will go through DU. If a loan scenario can’t get DU Approval, the LO probably shouldn’t price it as a conforming loan at all (or should know it must meet manual rules). There might be internal notes: e.g. “Max 45% DTI (50% with DU Approval)” in the guidelines displayed on OB. Indeed, product guidelines often state “DTI: up to 50% with DU Approve; 45% max if manually underwritten” – these appear in OB’s details. If the LO inputs a 48% DTI and a 620 score, OB will show the product, assuming DU approve. If DU later says no, that’s outside OB’s immediate scope – that’s between underwriting and the LO. Some investors on OB might list separate products like “Conforming Manual UW” with certain adjustments or not show them to brokers. But generally, OB doesn’t separately price manual vs DU. Encompass on the other hand will know from DU findings if the loan is Approve or Refer. If DU is Refer, Encompass might automatically apply the manual underwriting checklist and ensure those criteria are present. Many lenders will just not proceed if DU is Refer (except maybe for no-score loans).
One area affecting pricing indirectly: if DU gives an Approve/Ineligible due to a guideline issue that can’t be fixed, the loan might have to go to a different channel (like a non-conforming portfolio loan with different pricing). For example, a loan with a Refer due to credit issues might end up being done FHA or non-QM, which pricing engine can pivot to those products (with higher rates). So while OB doesn’t adjust conforming pricing because of DU/Manual, the outcome of AUS might push the LO to price an alternative product. Some PPEs integrate DU such that they won’t lock a loan unless DU Approved. But generally the LO locks the rate assuming it’ll be approved. If later it isn’t, they might have to break the lock or change programs.
From a loan delivery standpoint, lenders deliver a code if a loan was manually underwritten (there’s usually an indicator in loan delivery). That doesn’t affect price, but Fannie tracks those.
In sum, pricing engines assume AUS findings will be satisfactory, and do not explicitly incorporate the tougher manual thresholds except as static guide info. The onus is on the LO and underwriter to know that, for instance, a 50% DTI loan better have DU Approve or it won’t close. OB might not stop you from locking a 50% DTI loan with 620 score on a conforming 30-year (since DU might approve if compensating factors); if DU later says no, then the lock may have to be canceled or converted to a different product. Some lenders’ policies might then charge a fee or re-lock. So, practically, LOs often run DU first, then price/lock.
Thus, AUS vs Manual is more an underwriting process difference than a pricing one. Pricing engines do highlight “must get DU Approve/Eligible” in product descriptions (which is a given). If a loan must be manually underwritten (like a no-score loan), some lenders won’t do it, so those products might not appear unless criteria match (OB might not have a filter for “no credit score” scenario; that might require a manual search in guidelines).
Overall, DU findings are king – pricing engine trusts that if you’re pricing a conforming loan, you plan to get DU approval. The moment you cannot, either the loan is out (and no pricing applies) or goes manual if possible (with no price change). The only time price might change is if a lender charges an extra fee for manual (which would be an overlay, not common in rate sheets). Usually it’s pass/fail rather than price adjust.

14. First-Time Homebuyer (FTHB) Status and Restrictions

Definition: A first-time homebuyer is typically defined by Fannie Mae as an individual who has not owned a residential property in the past 3 years ￼. This status matters for certain high-LTV programs and may come with additional requirements (like homeownership education). Fannie Mae’s standard loan programs mostly don’t require the borrower to be first-time, except when using specific features: notably, to get up to 97% LTV on a standard Conventional loan, at least one borrower must be a first-time homebuyer if the LTV > 95% (and the loan is not a special program like HomeReady) ￼. Also, some assistance or low-down programs explicitly target first-time buyers. First-time buyers (especially if ALL borrowers are first-time) are required to take a homebuyer education course when using certain high LTV or affordable products ￼. Fannie’s HomeReady program does not require the borrower to be first-time (but if they are, they must do education). However, Fannie’s HomeOne (Freddie Mac) or certain HFAs require first-time status. For Fannie, the main time first-time status is a factor: the 97% LTV standard product, and the extra LLPA waivers/credits introduced recently for first-time buyers under certain income limits ￼. Additionally, Fannie tracks if a loan is to someone who will be a first-time owner, as part of its mission and for HMDA reporting. There was historically also a specific risk considered: first-timers may have higher default risk due to limited housing experience – but Fannie’s current policy is more about providing support (education, LLPA waivers) rather than restricting them, except for the above LTV rule.

Purpose & Risk Logic: The requirement that one borrower be first-time for >95% LTV standard loans is to ensure the 97% option is used as intended – primarily by new entrants to homeownership who might need the lower down payment. If someone already owned a home, Fannie expects them to use the proceeds or equity (so they can likely put more than 3% down, or they should use other program like HomeReady or 95% options). It’s partly to target help and partly to control risk (experienced owners presumably have equity to bring, so if they are putting only 3% down, why? That could indicate something else – but mainly it’s a policy choice to limit 97% to first-timers except HomeReady). The homeownership education requirement for first-timers (especially on high LTV or HomeReady loans) is to mitigate risk by improving borrower understanding of budgeting, maintenance, etc. Data suggests educated buyers are less likely to default. As for LLPA waivers: in 2023, FHFA implemented waiving certain upfront fees for first-time buyers with income ≤ 100% of AMI to improve affordability ￼. This was to help new homeowners overcome cost barriers. Conversely, first-time buyers with very low down payments historically had slightly higher default rates, but that is offset by requiring education and MI. In summary, Fannie’s guidelines incorporate first-time status to either restrict ultra-high LTV use or to provide benefits/requirements that address the unique needs/risks of first-time buyers (education to reduce delinquency risk, fee waivers to encourage sustainable homeownership).

Thresholds & Constraints:
	•	97% LTV Eligibility: For a standard Conventional 97 loan (not HomeReady/HomePossible), at least one borrower must be first-time homebuyer if LTV > 95% ￼. If none are first-time, max LTV is 95%. (An exception: the RefiNow 97% refi doesn’t require first-time because it’s a refi of an existing loan).
	•	Education: If all occupying borrowers are first-time and the loan is >95% LTV (or is HomeReady, regardless of LTV), at least one borrower must complete a housing counseling or homeownership education course from an acceptable provider ￼. The standard is Fannie Mae’s free HomeView online course or similar (about 6-8 hours) ￼. For HomeReady, education is required for first-time buyers (and even gives an LLPA credit if done with one-on-one counseling ￼ ￼). The education must be done before closing and a completion certificate retained.
	•	First-Time Definition Nuances: Married borrowers – if one owned a home in last 3 years and the other didn’t, they wouldn’t qualify as “all first-time” (so the one with prior ownership makes the pair not first-time). But for the >95% rule, only one needs to be first-time (so that is satisfied even if the spouse owned before, as long as one meets the 3-year absence).
	•	Programs specifically for First-Time Buyers: Some Housing Finance Agencies or assistance programs layered with Fannie’s loans require first-time status. But that’s programmatic outside of core Fannie. Fannie itself doesn’t have a “only for first-timers” program except that standard 97% (and historically MyCommunityMortgage which became HomeReady dropped that).
	•	LLPA Waivers: New as of 2023, Fannie (FHFA) eliminated LLPA fees for first-time homebuyers with income ≤ 100% of Area Median Income (or 120% in high-cost areas) ￼. So a qualifying first-time buyer effectively avoids many credit/LTV based LLPAs. However, this is implemented via an LLPA waiver at delivery (and pricing engines incorporate it). See LLPA Matrix: it lists “Loans to first-time homebuyers <=100% AMI – all LLPAs waived” ￼. That’s a huge benefit. If income is above the limit or not first-time, they pay normal LLPAs.
	•	Risk management: There is no additional reserve or DTI requirement specifically for first-timers in Fannie’s guide, but lenders often watch that more closely. Some may require a first-timer to have one month reserve even if not required, etc., but not an official rule.
	•	Tracking: Lenders indicate first-time homebuyer in the loan delivery data. HMDA reporting also requires identifying if someone is first-time, for fair lending stats.

Formula/Calculation: Checking first-time status for a scenario:

borrower1_owned_in_last_3yrs = False
borrower2_owned_in_last_3yrs = True
any_first_time = (not borrower1_owned_in_last_3yrs) or (not borrower2_owned_in_last_3yrs)
all_first_time = (not borrower1_owned_in_last_3yrs) and (not borrower2_owned_in_last_3yrs)
LTV = 0.97

if LTV > 0.95:
    if any_first_time:
        eligible = True  # at least one FTHB, meets Fannie 97% guideline [oai_citation:221‡kiss.themoneysource.com](https://kiss.themoneysource.com/docs/Corr_FannieMaeMatrix.pdf#:~:text=Loan%20Purpose%20%E2%80%A2%20Purchase%20o,Out%20Refinance)
    else:
        eligible = False
        reason = "No first-time buyer present for >95% LTV [oai_citation:222‡kiss.themoneysource.com](https://kiss.themoneysource.com/docs/Corr_FannieMaeMatrix.pdf#:~:text=Loan%20Purpose%20%E2%80%A2%20Purchase%20o,Out%20Refinance)."
else:
    eligible = True

print(f"At 97% LTV: {'Eligible' if eligible else 'Ineligible'}", (reason if not eligible else ""))

In this scenario, Borrower1 is first-time, Borrower2 is not, any_first_time = True, so the 97% LTV is allowed (one first-timer in the mix). If neither were first-time, it would flag ineligible.

For education requirement:

if all_first_time and LTV > 0.95:
    education_required = True
else:
    education_required = False

If education_required is True, then loan approval will be conditional on providing a certificate.

Pricing Engine Implementation: Pricing engines have started to incorporate the new first-time homebuyer LLPA waivers and credits. For example, Optimal Blue now likely asks or has a toggle: “First-Time Homebuyer: Yes/No” and “Income <= AMI: Yes/No” to determine if the LLPA waiver applies. If the user indicates “yes” to both, OB will remove certain LLPAs from the price (or apply the appropriate credit as per the matrix) ￼. This can make a noticeable difference in price (for instance, a 95% LTV loan for a 680 FICO first-time <= AMI might save 1.5% in fees versus if not first-time). If these fields are not correctly input, pricing could be off. Similarly, OB may filter programs: if LTV 97% and user says “No” to first-time, OB might not show the standard 97% product (or might flag “Requires at least one first-time buyer”). In many cases, lenders solve this by making the 97% product auto-require in their system that first-time box is checked or that it’s HomeReady. OB likely has logic: if LTV > 95 on a Conv Fixed 30, then either you must select FTHB=Yes or switch to HomeReady. It might default to HomeReady product if not FTHB. Some lenders simply treat all >95% LTV as HomeReady (which doesn’t require first-time but has income limits).
Also, OB can incorporate the education requirement informationally: it might note “Homeownership counseling required” on results for certain scenarios, but it doesn’t affect pricing. That’s more of a disclosure.
From a lock perspective, indicating first-time and income could yield better price due to waived LLPAs (since May 2023 changes). LOs need to know to mark those in OB to get the improved price. Encompass and DU: you must input if borrower is first-time (DU will then enforce the education requirement in messaging and also determine HomeReady $500 LLPA credit if housing counseling done) ￼ ￼.
Additionally, some bond programs or grants only available to first-timers might appear in OB if that filter is on. OB’s search filters may include “First-time Homebuyer Assistance” to show specialized products. But standard conforming: main effect is on LLPAs and eligibility for 97%.
If a user forgot to mark someone as first-time in OB on a 97% scenario, OB might not show that product or might price it with normal LLPAs (worse price). If they mark yes, it will show availability and better pricing. So it’s important.
All in all, pricing engines do pay attention to first-time status now because of those fee waivers. And of course, if a lender doesn’t allow some program for non-first-timers, OB accounts for that.
So, integrally:
	•	OB/Encompass ensure if >95 LTV on standard conv, FTHB flag is checked or they switch to HomeReady (which allows non-FTHB if income-eligible).
	•	OB applies “FTHB <=100% AMI LLPA Waiver” to the pricing when applicable ￼.
	•	The LO and underwriter ensure the borrower actually qualifies as first-time (no ownership last 3 years) by reviewing credit and declarations. A misrepresentation could cause repurchase if discovered (because loan was delivered with wrong data on first-time status or education not done).
Thus, FTHB status is an important attribute in the pricing/eligibility process for high LTV loans and pricing adjustments starting in 2023.

15. High-Cost Loans and High-Risk Designations (HOEPA High-Cost, HPML, HCLTV)

Definition: This rule covers compliance and eligibility related to High-Cost Mortgages and Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans (HPML), as well as the concept of High Combined LTV (HCLTV) in certain contexts. A High-Cost Mortgage (per HOEPA, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act) is a loan that exceeds federal or state “high-cost” thresholds (very high APR or fees relative to the loan amount). Fannie Mae will not purchase loans that are classified as HOEPA high-cost mortgages ￼. An HPML is defined by Truth in Lending as a consumer loan with APR above a certain margin over the Average Prime Offer Rate (e.g. APR ≥ 1.5% over APOR on a first lien). HPML loans are allowed for Fannie delivery as long as they comply with HPML rules (escrow accounts for a year, etc.), but there’s heightened scrutiny. Fannie doesn’t explicitly prohibit HPMLs – many loans to lower-credit borrowers can be HPML. However, lenders must ensure they still meet Ability-to-Repay/QM (Qualified Mortgage) standards and any additional appraisal requirements (HPML requires a second appraisal in some flip situations, etc.). The High Combined LTV (HCLTV) is a ratio used when there is a HELOC second lien: it’s the first mortgage + the full credit line of the HELOC divided by value ￼. Fannie’s Eligibility Matrix often lists LTV/CLTV/HCLTV limits – e.g., on a HELOC, they consider HCLTV. For example, Fannie may allow CLTV up to 95% with a HELOC, but if that HELOC isn’t fully drawn, the HCLTV might be higher; some programs cap HCLTV (for instance, some Community Seconds allow CLTV 105% but HCLTV 105% as well in that case – HCLTV is normally only an issue if HELOC not fully drawn). The term “High Risk” might also refer to certain loan features Fannie flags (like high DTI might have been considered high risk for delivery if manual, etc., or investment properties could be called higher risk). But mainly, from a selling perspective: HOEPA high-cost = ineligible ￼, HPML = eligible but lender must comply with Reg Z, and HCLTV simply is a ratio that must not exceed the max allowed (like if HCLTV > allowed, loan is ineligible even if CLTV is within allowed, because borrower could draw the HELOC fully).

Purpose & Risk Logic: HOEPA High-Cost loans are generally loans with very high fees or rates, often predatory in nature. Fannie Mae (and Freddie) have long refused to purchase them to avoid legal exposure and because such loans indicate very high risk or predatory lending that they do not want to support ￼. So if a loan triggers HOEPA (APR or points exceed the threshold ~ e.g. > 6.5% above APOR or total points > 5% etc.), Fannie won’t buy it. Lenders must test each loan; any “Section 32” loan is a straight no. HPML (Higher-Priced) loans have more moderate triggers and just require certain protections (escrows for 5 years, etc.). Fannie is okay with HPML as long as those requirements are met because HPMLs are still QM as long as they pass ATR and do not exceed QM APR limits. They do not pose direct sale risk, but they do pose rep & warrant risk if not done correctly. HCLTV considerations: If a borrower has a large unused HELOC on the property (say a credit line up to 100% CLTV), Fannie knows they could go draw that immediately after closing. So, for risk management, Fannie often treats HCLTV as equal to CLTV for eligibility if credit line > balance. That’s why the matrix shows a column for HCLTV. For example, if max CLTV allowed is 95% but the borrower has a HELOC that could take them to 105%, that HCLTV=105% might not be allowed (the matrix footnotes often say “CLTV > 95% only with Community Seconds up to 105%, otherwise subordinate financing must be <= 95 CLTV/HCLTV”). The logic is to account for potential future debt. In summary, Fannie’s policy is: absolutely no loans that violate HOEPA high-cost thresholds (too risky and legal no-go) ￼; be cautious but allow HPMLs (most loans to lower FICOs will be HPML) with proper compliance; and ensure combined leverage including undrawn credit lines doesn’t exceed program limits (HCLTV).

Thresholds & Constraints:
	•	HOEPA High-Cost: Federal HOEPA thresholds (2025) – roughly, if APR exceeds the APOR by more than 6.5% on first liens, or if points & fees exceed 5% of loan amount (for loans ≥ $22k), it’s high-cost. These are usually subprime-level pricing. Fannie’s Selling Guide explicitly says such loans are not eligible ￼. Many states also have “high-cost home loan” laws with various triggers; Fannie requires compliance and also will not buy if classified as high-cost under those laws (most lenders avoid crossing those triggers anyway).
	•	HPML: Defined if APR ≥ APOR + 1.5% (for conforming first lien). Many standard loans to borrowers with rates in the 6-7% range these days and APOR ~5% become HPML. Fannie will buy HPML loans but the lender must have an escrow account for at least 5 years (for taxes/insurance) and must have given the borrower the required TILA disclosures. Also, HPML loans still must be QM – but note: small disparity, QM safe harbor vs rebuttable presumption is based on APR vs APOR + 1.5%. If a loan is HPML, it’s still QM (rebuttable presumption) if DTI ≤ 43 or meets GSE Patch (approved by DU). Fannie doesn’t explicitly differentiate safe harbor vs rebuttable presumption in selling guide – they just require the loan meets QM. So a HPML can still be sold (just not protected by safe harbor, but that’s lender’s risk).
	•	Appraisal rule for HPML flips: If the home was acquired by seller in last 180 days and price is increasing significantly, HPML rule might require a second appraisal. Lenders selling to Fannie must abide by that (Fannie expects lenders to comply with all Regulation Z rules). But Fannie doesn’t collect info about that in loan delivery except via reps/warrants that all laws are complied with. So that’s on the lender.
	•	HCLTV Limits: Fannie’s Eligibility Matrix lists maximum LTV/CLTV/HCLTV for each scenario ￼ ￼. Often CLTV and HCLTV limits are the same, but in cases of HELOC, HCLTV could be higher. Most standard conventional: max CLTV/HCLTV = same percent (e.g. 95% CLTV and 95% HCLTV on a fixed rate). Some exceptions: for example, certain limited refis allowed CLTV 105% with HCLTV also 105% (Community Seconds). If HCLTV is above a threshold (like if a HELOC’s line pushes it over), that loan is “Ineligible.” Lender would need to either reduce line or treat that as part of total LTV. Actually, DU will compute HCLTV; if it’s beyond limit, DU gives Ineligible. E.g., primary home cash-out max CLTV 80%. If someone had a HELOC (even $0 balance) that goes to 90%, HCLTV=90% and DU will shout ineligible cause HCLTV>80 allowed.
	•	“High Risk Home Loans”: There used to be a concept in Fannie’s risk-based pricing where loans with certain combinations (low score, high LTV, etc.) were labeled as “High Risk” requiring certain things (like some high-LTV loans require at least one borrower be a first-time – actually that’s current for >95 – or require homeownership counseling for high LTV and low income etc.). This might also refer to if a loan is subject to additional fees, etc. However, at present Fannie doesn’t have a “high risk loan” category except maybe in LLPA context (e.g. prior to May 2023 changes, a loan > 40% DTI had a new LLPA making it “high risk” – that was removed).
	•	Compliance delivery: Fannie expects lenders to represent that the loan complies with all laws (which includes HOEPA/HPML). Fannie had a specific rep that no HOEPA high-cost or state high-cost laws are triggered ￼. There’s typically a check box in delivery “HOEPA Status: Section32 = No”.

Formula/Calculation: Determining if a loan is HOEPA or HPML:

APR = 8.0  # example APR%
APOR = 5.5  # Average Prime Offer Rate for similar loan
points_percent = 4.0  # total points as % of loan

is_HPML = APR >= APOR + 1.5  # for first lien
is_HOEPA = False
# HOEPA thresholds (simplified):
if APR >= APOR + 6.5 or points_percent > 5.0:
    is_HOEPA = True

if is_HOEPA:
    eligibility = "Ineligible (HOEPA high-cost loan) [oai_citation:236‡lexology.com](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=41307dbd-3ecd-404f-9309-8715e55c47ba#:~:text=loan%20information%20to%20Fannie%20Mae,predatory%20lending%20quality%20control%20process)"
elif is_HPML:
    eligibility = "HPML: Eligible if ATR/QM and escrow requirements are met"
else:
    eligibility = "Neither HPML nor HOEPA - no special restrictions"
print(eligibility)

For example, if APR 8.0, APOR 5.5 -> APR is 2.5 above APOR => HPML true. Points 4% so not high-cost by points, APR 2.5 above (less than 6.5) so not HOEPA. So it would print eligible as HPML scenario. The lender then must ensure escrow (which they do by default on HPML) and document ATR (which DU does).
If points were 6%, is_HOEPA would flip True and output ineligible.

Pricing Engine Implementation: Pricing engines incorporate these factors mainly by ensuring compliance:
	•	HPML: OB and others might indicate if a scenario likely is HPML. They know the rate and APOR (they have APOR data by date). OB actually can calculate an estimated APR and compare to APOR. If a scenario is trending into HPML territory, the LO should know but OB could alert “Note: Loan may be HPML, ensure escrow for 5 years and second appraisal if flip.” Many PPEs don’t automatically display APOR, but Encompass has an indicator. Some lenders embed in OB an adjustment that certain products cannot exceed certain APR (some credit unions or overlays avoid HPML). But Fannie doesn’t price HPML differently, so OB’s pricing per se doesn’t change. It’s more of a compliance overlay. Typically, it’s handled post-lock: Compliance software checks APR vs APOR.
	•	HOEPA: OB will not price a scenario if points are input above 5%. Actually, OB doesn’t always know your exact fees at quote time (they mostly do rate/price). But Encompass or doc prep will flag if points > 5%. Many lenders’ rate lock systems simply prevent locking a loan if points > threshold or APR above certain threshold. OB could filter out interest rates that would make APR too high? Not sure. Usually pricing engines aren’t directly incorporating HOEPA calc because it depends on fees which the LO might not fully input in OB scenario. Instead, lenders rely on closing cost details later to ensure HOEPA isn’t triggered. But OB could have a message if base points are too high.
	•	Loan-Level Price Adjustments: None are directly for HPML or HOEPA. HOEPA just disqualifies. HPML might indirectly correlate with risk (like lower FICO -> more LLPAs -> higher APR -> could become HPML). If a scenario is approaching HOEPA, the LO likely has to reduce fees or rate.
	•	High LTV: For HCLTV, OB does have fields for subordinate financing. If a second lien is a HELOC, OB typically asks for “HELOC line amount” vs “HELOC balance”. OB can then compute CLTV and HCLTV and apply the correct eligibility. If HCLTV is above allowed, OB might not show conforming products. For example, if user input: existing HELOC line $50k, drawn $0, home value $100k, first mortgage $80k (so CLTV 80%, HCLTV 130%), that clearly violates. OB likely either doesn’t have a smart detection or just uses HCLTV=CLTV? In DU, the user inputs credit line and balance; DU calculates HCLTV. OB might not explicitly enforce HCLTV except through guideline if/then’s. But a well-configured PPE could: If subordinate financing type = HELOC and CLTV < HCLTV, check HCLTV vs matrix. Possibly OB relies on the LO to know the max. More likely, OB addresses this by requiring compliance with matrix which includes HCLTV. So if a scenario doesn’t meet, OB might show product but under “Ineligible” notes: “HCLTV exceeds max allowed”.
Given fewer loans have seconds nowadays, OB’s focus is mainly first-lien. If subordinate financing is present, OB typically asks type and amount to ensure LTV/CLTV fit program (some programs allow seconds, some not).
	•	Pricing Impact: Being HPML doesn’t directly change rate pricing from Fannie’s side. But some lenders may price a little higher for HPML because of rep and warrant risk (lack of safe harbor). However, in competitive markets, most don’t explicitly adjust rate; they just ensure compliance. HOEPA is a hard stop, not a price thing.
	•	Locking: A LO uses OB to pick a rate. If that rate makes APR go high, the LO might have to pick a slightly lower rate to avoid HPML or a much lower to avoid HOEPA. That’s more trial and error. Some PPE tools might highlight “APR for this scenario is X, APOR is Y, this is HPML” so LO can consider if they can still proceed (maybe they can, with escrows). If it says “This would be HOEPA high-cost”, LO will likely adjust points or rate because they know it can’t be sold.
Encompass and compliance software do a thorough check before closing docs. If a loan is accidentally locked with too high fees, they must cure or withdraw. Lenders rather avoid that early.
So pricing engines aren’t heavily involved in HOEPA/HPML beyond maybe warnings. The main integration is: the LO must ensure not to structure a loan that hits HOEPA. OB can help by showing points and allowing LO to adjust to keep it under 5%. Many times, if a borrower wants to buy down the rate with points that push >5%, the lender will cap it to avoid HOEPA.
For HCLTV, DU and the underwriter ensure compliance. OB including second lien fields helps filter products that allow high CLTV (like HomeReady up to 105% with community second).
In summary, Fannie’s stance: absolutely no purchase of HOEPA loans (pricing engine might alert but won’t allow such a scenario to be considered eligible) ￼; HPML loans are allowed – pricing engine doesn’t change price but may alert – it’s on lender to ensure escrow and that the loan is a QM (which it will be if DU Approved); HCLTV issues will be caught by AUS eligibility – pricing engines ensure they gather data for CLTV/HCLTV and check against product guidelines (so if HCLTV too high, product is likely marked ineligible in results).

16. Loan-Level Price Adjustments (LLPAs) and Waivers/Exceptions

Definition: Loan-Level Price Adjustments (LLPAs) are risk-based fees charged by Fannie Mae at loan delivery based on certain loan characteristics such as credit score, LTV ratio, occupancy, property type, etc. ￼. Essentially, they are point adjustments to the pricing of a loan – either charged as a fee or built into the interest rate. Fannie publishes an LLPA matrix (updated periodically) specifying these fees (e.g. add 1.250% fee for a 680 FICO at 95% LTV, or 0.75% for a condo, etc.) ￼ ￼. Some loans may also get LLPA waivers or credits: for example, as of 2024, Fannie Mae waives all LLPAs for certain affordable qualifying loans (first-time homebuyer under AMI limit) ￼, or gives a $500 credit for completion of housing counseling on HomeReady loans ￼ ￼. There are also special waivers: e.g., LLPA for energy-efficient improvements could be waived, or if a loan is a HomeReady loan to very low-income, a large LLPA credit is given ￼. Essentially, waivers are exceptions where specific LLPA charges in the matrix are forgiven (often via special feature code). For instance, the recent elimination of LLPA for DTI>40% is one such removal (as of 2023, that LLPA was removed entirely). Another waiver example: the Adverse Market Delivery Charge that existed at times and then waived. So in summary, LLPAs are upfront pricing hits applied to loans, and waivers are situations where those hits are not applied or counteracted by credits. Pricing engines must incorporate these to accurately quote rates.

Purpose & Risk Logic: LLPAs allow Fannie Mae to price for risk on individual loans. Borrowers with lower credit scores or smaller down payments statistically present higher default risk, so Fannie collects a higher fee to compensate (or to discourage the riskiest combinations). For example, a 95% LTV loan with a 640 FICO might have a total LLPA of 2.75% ￼, which either the borrower pays via higher rate or points – this pricing adjusts for expected losses. LLPAs also encourage certain behaviors; for instance, second homes/investments have steep LLPAs to account for risk and to align with mission (FHFA recently increased second home LLPAs significantly to curtail volume). Waivers are used to promote certain policy goals or correct market anomalies: e.g., waiving LLPAs for first-time low-income buyers encourages affordability (reduces their closing costs) ￼. Waiving or lowering MI LLPAs for HomeReady encourages use of that program by making it cheaper for very low-income borrowers ￼. In Fannie’s risk management, if an LLPA is waived (like for first-timers <=100% AMI), it’s because FHFA decided to cross-subsidize that group – the lost revenue is made up by charging other loans slightly more or by mandate. From a capital perspective, LLPAs ensure Fannie gets adequate yield for risk-based capital requirements. Notably, FHFA in 2023 revamped LLPAs to better align with borrower credit risk (some mid-FICO borrowers saw lower LLPAs, while very high FICO saw slight increases) to even out pricing fairness. Fannie also sometimes uses LLPAs to manage volume or policy: e.g., in 2022 they added a 4% LLPA on high-balance and second home loans to slow those (due to cap constraints). In 2023 they removed that for first-time <= AMI on high-balance (in effect waiving those). Loan-Level Price Adjustment Matrix changes are a big deal for lenders – pricing engines must update them promptly as they directly affect rate sheets.

Thresholds & Constraints: Key aspects of LLPAs:
	•	Credit Score & LTV Grid: The main LLPA table is segmented by credit score ranges (e.g. ≥780, 760-779, … <640) and LTV buckets (≤60%, 60.01-70%, … >95%). Each cell has a fee (in points) ￼. For example, a 720 FICO, 85% LTV purchase might have 1.25% fee ￼. This covers primary residences >15-year term (there’s separate smaller LLPA for ≤15yr loans). If multiple borrowers, Fannie uses representative score (lowest median). Loans with no score delivered are charged as if <620 in LLPAs (i.e. highest fees).
	•	Loan Attributes Adjustments: There is a table of add-ons for specific features ￼:
	•	Investment property: e.g. 2.125% add-on for 1-unit investment at some LTVs ￼.
	•	Second home: historically similar to investment now (e.g. ~2% at many LTVs after 2022 changes).
	•	2-4 unit property: maybe 0.375%-0.750% depending on LTV (since multi-unit risk).
	•	Manufactured home: 0.50% or so ￼.
	•	Condo: 0.00% at low LTV, up to 0.75% at high LTV (some older matrices had 0.75% if >75% LTV).
	•	Adjustable-rate mortgage: currently maybe 0% for ARMs up to certain LTV then small add (older matrices had small fees for ARMs over 75% LTV) ￼.
	•	High-balance (for loans in high-cost areas above baseline conforming): e.g. 0.25% if ≤80% LTV, up to 0.75% at high LTV ￼ (recently reduced for some).
	•	Subordinate financing presence: used to have 0.125% if CLTV > 80 (but not sure current matrix).
	•	Delivery by channel: (not in current matrix, but historically they had separate LLPAs for certain risk layering).
	•	Cap on total LLPAs: Fannie historically had a cap of 3% or 3.75% on total LLPAs to ensure affordability, but they removed explicit cap. Instead, they target not making any combination exceed QM’s 3% points limit for typical loan amounts. However, some combos do exceed 3%. It’s on lender to either get borrower to pay them or lender pay, as long as ATR is satisfied (the QM rule’s 3% points cap for Safe Harbor, but loan can still be QM rebuttable if >3% but <= APOR+1.5).
	•	Waivers & Credits: As of Dec 2024 matrix ￼:
	•	First-Time Homebuyer with income ≤100% AMI (≤120% in high cost): All LLPAs waived (except MI LLPA still applies if they choose reduced MI) ￼. That is huge – effectively zero LLPA. They just must deliver SFC indicating FTHB and income class.
	•	HomeReady loans: Already had reduced LLPA matrix or specific credit: e.g. HomeReady for ≤50% AMI gets a $2,500 LLPA credit (effectively negative LLPA) ￼, and from table it appears HomeReady in general has no credit score based LLPAs (they are waived, replaced by just a flat -$500 if very low income or -$0 if regular HomeReady) ￼.
	•	Housing Counseling Credit: If a HomeReady borrower or other scenario took a qualified counseling before contract, and delivered SFC 184, they get a $500 LLPA credit ￼. This incentivizes extra education.
	•	Green mortgage (HomeStyle Energy): had $500 credit (SFC 375) ￼.
	•	RefiNow option: had $500 credit if appraisal was obtained but loan delivered without appraisal (value acceptance) to reimburse appraisal cost ￼.
	•	Those credits are applied at delivery – pricing engines will incorporate them in rate if known upfront.
	•	Minimum MI LLPA: If a lender chooses lower MI coverage (see Rule 8), an LLPA applies (like 0.125% to 0.75% depending on LTV and term) ￼. That is a negative for borrower but some do it to avoid monthly MI. Pricing engine accounts for that by adding the fee if Financed MI with lower coverage chosen.
	•	Temporary waivers: e.g. in early pandemic Fannie waived some LLPAs for loans with appraisal waivers or for certain refinances they had an Adverse Market Fee of 0.5% for a while then removed it – OB promptly updated those.
	•	Execution: Lenders can pay LLPA or charge borrower. Usually it’s built into rate pricing. E.g. a loan with 2% total LLPAs might result in ~0.25% higher rate.
	•	Lenders must deliver Special Feature Codes (SFCs) to indicate when waivers apply (like SFC 873 for first-time low-income waiver, etc.). If they mis-deliver, Fannie might still charge the LLPA. So accuracy matters.

Formula: Pricing with LLPAs:

base_price = 100.00  # price at par for given rate
llpa_fees = {
    "credit_LTV": 1.250,   # e.g. from matrix for given credit & LTV
    "invest_prop": 2.125,  # investment property add
    "condo": 0.750,        # condo add
}
total_llpa = sum(llpa_fees.values())  # e.g. 4.125%
# Waiver example:
first_time_low_inc = True
if first_time_low_inc:
    total_llpa = 0.0  # waive all
else:
    # apply any credits
    if counseling_completed:
        total_llpa -= 0.125  # $500 on a 400k loan ~0.125%
# Compute adjusted price
price_adjustment = - total_llpa  # 4.125% LLPA means price -4.125
final_price = base_price + price_adjustment
print(f"Total LLPA: {total_llpa:.3f}%, Final Price: {final_price:.3f}")

This shows how LLPAs reduce the price lenders pay. If base 100 (par), and total LLPAs 4.125%, final execution price to lender is 95.875. They’d pass this to borrower as either points or higher rate. If waiver applied dropping LLPA to 0, price stays 100 – big difference.

Pricing Engine Implementation: Optimal Blue and other PPEs explicitly incorporate LLPAs into rate quotes. When a user enters loan criteria (credit score, LTV, occupancy, property type, etc.), OB pulls the lender’s base rate (which is often set at some reference like for top tier scenario) and then applies all relevant LLPAs to compute an adjusted price. Lenders input their LLPA matrices into OB or OB has Fannie’s matrix built in and lender adds any overlays. For example, OB will add 0.750 pricing hit if “condo” is selected and LTV > 75%. Or if user enters FICO 680 and LTV 85%, OB will include maybe a 1.5 point LLPA. The LO doesn’t necessarily see each component (though OB can show adjustments detail), but the final price includes them. If a scenario qualifies for a waiver, OB will remove those. OB recently added fields for “First Time Homebuyer” and “Income <= AMI” to properly apply the new LLPA waivers effective Dec 2022/May 2023. If LO checks those, many adjustments drop off behind the scenes. We saw the Fannie matrix excerpt where “All LLPAs waived” for those loans ￼ – OB implemented that likely by applying a negative adjustment equal to sum of all other adjustments or by having a flag that bypasses normal adjustments. Similarly, OB has logic for HomeReady: if program = HomeReady, it uses the HomeReady LLPA matrix which has reduced fees and possible credits (like -$2,500 for very low income – OB may just bump price up by 2.5 points as a credit). The housing counseling credit of $500 (0.125%) can be toggled if LO indicates counseling completed – OB then adds +0.125 to price. Lenders also can manually adjust pricing to account for LLPAs not captured (though OB covers almost all standard ones).
Important: Misinputs can drastically change price – e.g. forgetting to mark FTHB when applicable can show a worse price (with LLPAs) when in reality it could be waived – possibly making LO quote a higher rate than needed. OB’s UI likely encourages marking those fields.
Encompass: When locking a loan, Encompass might interface with a pricing engine or the lender’s pricing which includes LLPAs. Also, at delivery, Encompass or the lender’s system ensures the correct SFCs are in place to get waivers. Pricing engine doesn’t handle SFC codes per se, but ensures price reflects if the loan is structured to qualify.
Lenders can also apply custom LLPAs (overlays) via OB – like “our bank charges 0.25 extra for condos in Florida” – but that’s outside Fannie’s, just internal margin. OB can incorporate those too.
So basically, OB ensures that the rate shown already accounts for all Fannie charges. If a borrower wants to pay no points, OB picks a rate where final price ~100 after LLPAs. Or if they take a slightly higher rate, maybe price >100 offsets LLPAs.
For waivers: OB likely doesn’t automatically apply if the LO doesn’t flag eligibility – so LO training is key. For example, if LO doesn’t realize their borrower is under AMI and first-time, they might not check that, and OB will show an extra perhaps 1% in fees – making the loan look worse. Conversely, OB might automatically detect if the income entered is below a certain threshold for the census tract and prompt “Loan may qualify for LLPA waiver, is borrower first-time? Yes/No” – depending on integration with income data.
Conclusion: Loan-level pricing adjustments are fully integrated into the pricing process. The engine calculates them in real-time so the LO sees accurate pricing for that loan’s risk factors. Waivers and exceptions introduced to LLPAs are updated in the engine’s logic (e.g. in May 2023, OB updated to remove DTI LLPA and to incorporate new FTHB waivers). Lenders must keep OB current with any custom adjustments. The output to the user (LO) is simply an interest rate and point cost, but under the hood, OB has applied these granular adjustments per Fannie’s matrix ￼. This ensures that when the loan is delivered, the lender gets the expected net price from Fannie (if any LLPA was missed in pricing, the lender would eat that cost). Thus, accuracy in LLPAs in the engine is critical for profitability and competitive pricing. Fannie’s waivers now also create scenarios of negative LLPA (credits) which OB handles by showing a price above par that can be used for borrower closing cost credits. For example, a HomeReady very low-income loan might show a price of 102 (2 points rebate) at a certain rate because Fannie is giving a 2.5 point credit ￼. OB reflects that, enabling LO to offer lower rates or help with costs. All of this demonstrates how deeply LLPAs and their exceptions are baked into the daily rate quotes produced by pricing engines for Fannie Mae loans.
